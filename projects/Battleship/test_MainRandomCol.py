Scenario 1: Test with standard square board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_square_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the random_col function's behavior when applied to a standard square board. We want to ensure that the function returns a valid column index in the range of the board's width.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a square board with a known width, for instance 5x5.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned index is within the range of the board's width (0 to width - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates that the random_col function correctly calculates the range of valid column indices for a square board and returns a value within that range. This is crucial for the function's core requirement of selecting a valid column.

Scenario 2: Test with rectangular board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_rectangular_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the random_col function's behavior when applied to a rectangular board. We want to ensure that the function returns a valid column index in the range of the board's width.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a rectangular board with a known width, for instance 3x5.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned index is within the range of the board's width (0 to width - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates that the random_col function correctly calculates the range of valid column indices for a rectangular board and returns a value within that range. This is important as the board may not always be square.

Scenario 3: Test with empty board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the random_col function when applied to an empty board. We expect the function to raise an exception in this case because there are no valid columns.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty board.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the empty board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that an IndexError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's robustness against invalid input. It ensures that the function does not return a misleading result when there are no valid columns to return.

Scenario 4: Test with non-empty board having no columns
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_no_column_board
  Description: This test is intended to check the behavior of the random_col function when applied to a non-empty board that has no columns. We expect the function to raise an exception in this case because there are no valid columns.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-empty board with no columns.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that an IndexError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's robustness against unusual but valid input. It ensures that the function does not return a misleading result when there are no valid columns to return.
