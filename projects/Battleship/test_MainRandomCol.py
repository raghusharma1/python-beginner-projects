Scenario 1: Test with standard square board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_square_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the random_col function's behavior when applied to a standard square board. We want to ensure that the function returns a valid column index in the range of the board's width.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a square board with a known width, for instance 5x5.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned index is within the range of the board's width (0 to width - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates that the random_col function correctly calculates the range of valid columns and returns a valid column index. This is crucial for the function's core functionality and accuracy.

Scenario 2: Test with rectangular board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_rectangular_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the random_col function's behavior when applied to a rectangular board. We want to ensure that the function returns a valid column index in the range of the board's width, even when the board's height and width are not equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a rectangular board with known dimensions, for instance 5x3.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned index is within the range of the board's width (0 to width - 1).
Validation:
  This test validates that the random_col function correctly handles boards of varying dimensions, ensuring its versatility and reliability.

Scenario 3: Test with empty board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_col_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the random_col function's behavior when applied to an empty board. We want to check how the function handles this edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty board.
  Act: Invoke the random_col function with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is raised, since there are no columns in an empty board for the function to return an index from.
Validation:
  This test validates the robustness of the random_col function, ensuring it handles edge cases gracefully and does not crash when faced with unexpected inputs.
