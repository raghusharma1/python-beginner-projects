```
Scenario 1: Validate that the shuffle function returns a list of unique tuples
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_returns_unique_tuples
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffle function returns a list of unique tuples, ensuring that there are no repeated moves.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board size.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function with the initialized board size.
  Assert: Check that all elements in the returned list are unique.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function is generating unique moves for a player. If the function were to generate repeated moves, it would not be working as intended.

Scenario 2: Validate that the shuffle function returns a list of correct length
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_returns_list_of_correct_length
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffle function returns a list of the correct length, which should be equal to the square of the board size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board size.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function with the initialized board size.
  Assert: Check that the length of the returned list is equal to the square of the board size.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function is generating the correct number of moves for a player. If the function were to generate more or fewer moves than expected, it would not be working as intended.

Scenario 3: Validate that the shuffle function returns a shuffled list
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_returns_shuffled_list
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffle function returns a shuffled list, meaning that the order of the elements in the list is not the same as the order in which they were generated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board size.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function with the initialized board size.
  Assert: Check that the order of the elements in the returned list is not the same as the order in which they were generated.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function is shuffling the moves for a player. If the function were to return the moves in the order in which they were generated, it would not be working as intended.

Scenario 4: Validate that the shuffle function works with different board sizes
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_works_with_different_board_sizes
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the shuffle function works with different board sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize different board sizes.
  Act: Invoke the shuffle function with the initialized board sizes.
  Assert: Check that the shuffle function returns a list of the correct length for each board size.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the shuffle function works with different board sizes. If the function were to fail with different board sizes, it would not be working as intended.
