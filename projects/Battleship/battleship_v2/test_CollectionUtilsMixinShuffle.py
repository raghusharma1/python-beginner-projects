```
Scenario 1: Test that shuffle generates the correct number of unique cell tuples
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_generates_correct_number_of_tuples
  Description: This test will verify that the shuffle function generates a list of tuples equal to the square of the board size, ensuring each cell on the board is included once.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a specific integer to board_size.
  Act: Call the shuffle function with the assigned board_size.
  Assert: Check that the length of the returned list is equal to the square of board_size.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the shuffle function correctly generates a unique cell for every position on the board, a critical requirement for game mechanics.

Scenario 2: Test that shuffle generates unique cell tuples
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_generates_unique_tuples
  Description: This test will verify that the shuffle function generates a list of unique tuples, ensuring no cell is repeated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a specific integer to board_size.
  Act: Call the shuffle function with the assigned board_size.
  Assert: Convert the returned list to a set and check that the length of the set is equal to the length of the list.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the shuffle function doesn't generate duplicate moves, which is crucial for the game's logic.

Scenario 3: Test that shuffle generates tuples within the correct range
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_generates_tuples_within_range
  Description: This test will verify that the shuffle function generates tuples within the correct range based on the board size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a specific integer to board_size.
  Act: Call the shuffle function with the assigned board_size.
  Assert: Iterate through the returned list and check that all tuples contain values less than board_size.
Validation:
  This test ensures that all generated moves are valid for the given board size, which is critical for the game's functionality.

Scenario 4: Test that shuffle generates different sequences for subsequent calls
Details:
  TestName: test_shuffle_generates_different_sequences
  Description: This test will verify that the shuffle function generates different sequences for subsequent calls, ensuring randomness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign a specific integer to board_size.
  Act: Call the shuffle function twice with the same board_size.
  Assert: Check that the two returned lists are not equal.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the shuffle function introduces randomness into the game, which is crucial for gameplay unpredictability.
