Scenario 1: Valid Attack Coordinate Input
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_attack_coordinates
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly processes a valid attack input, i.e., two integers within the board size range, separated by a space.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input with valid attack coordinates, and a mock board size.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple with the same coordinates as provided in the input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly interprets valid user input and returns the expected output, which is vital for the game to function properly.

Scenario 2: Invalid Attack Coordinate Input - Non-integer Values
Details:
  TestName: test_non_integer_attack_coordinates
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles non-integer input values and displays the appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input with non-integer values, and a mock board size.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function prints the error message and continues to prompt for input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle invalid user input and prompt the user to try again, thereby preventing crashes or undefined behavior.

Scenario 3: Invalid Attack Coordinate Input - Out of Range Values
Details:
  TestName: test_out_of_range_attack_coordinates
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles input values that are out of the board size range and displays the appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input with values that are out of the board size range, and a mock board size.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function prints the error message and continues to prompt for input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle user input that is out of range and prompt the user to try again, thereby maintaining the integrity of the game board.

Scenario 4: Invalid Attack Coordinate Input - Incorrect Number of Values
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_number_of_attack_coordinates
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles input with an incorrect number of values and displays the appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input with either too few or too many values, and a mock board size.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function prints the error message and continues to prompt for input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle user input with an incorrect number of values and prompt the user to try again, thereby ensuring that the game logic remains consistent.
