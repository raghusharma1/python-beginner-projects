```
Scenario 1: Valid String Input
Details:
  TestName: test_prompt_name_valid_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly accepts and returns a valid string input from a user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return a valid string.
  Act: Invoke the function with a prompt message.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the valid string that was mocked.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function behaves as expected when the user inputs a valid string, which is the primary use case for the function.

Scenario 2: Empty String Input
Details:
  TestName: test_prompt_name_empty_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles an empty string input from a user and displays the error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the function with a prompt message.
  Assert: Check that the error message is printed and that the function continues to prompt for input.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function behaves as expected when the user inputs an empty string. It also validates that the function does not accept empty strings as valid input, as per the business logic.

Scenario 3: String Input with Leading and Trailing Whitespaces
Details:
  TestName: test_prompt_name_whitespace_string
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly trims leading and trailing whitespaces from the user input and considers it invalid if the trimmed string is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return a string with leading and trailing whitespaces.
  Act: Invoke the function with a prompt message.
  Assert: Check that the function trims the whitespaces and either returns the trimmed string if it's not empty or displays the error message if it is.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function correctly handles strings with leading and trailing whitespaces, which are common user inputs.

Scenario 4: Custom Error Message
Details:
  TestName: test_prompt_name_custom_error_message
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly displays a custom error message when provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the function with a prompt message and a custom error message.
  Assert: Check that the custom error message is printed when the user inputs an empty string.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function correctly uses a custom error message when provided, which allows for greater flexibility and user-friendliness in error handling.
