Scenario 1: Test when two ships do not overlap
Details:
  TestName: test_ships_do_not_overlap
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when two ships do not share any common coordinates, the function is_ship_overlap should return False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two ship objects such that they do not share any common coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the second ship as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately identifies when two ships do not overlap. This is crucial for the game logic as overlapping ships are not allowed.

Scenario 2: Test when two ships do overlap
Details:
  TestName: test_ships_do_overlap
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when two ships share at least one common coordinate, the function is_ship_overlap should return True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two ship objects such that they share at least one common coordinate.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the second ship as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately identifies when two ships overlap. This is important for the game logic to prevent the placement of overlapping ships.

Scenario 3: Test when the other object is not a ship
Details:
  TestName: test_other_object_not_ship
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when the other object is not a ship, the function is_ship_overlap should raise a ValueError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object and another object that is not of the Ship class.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the non-ship object as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies when the other object is not a ship and raises an appropriate error. This is necessary for maintaining the integrity of the game logic.

Scenario 4: Test when the other ship is the same ship
Details:
  TestName: test_other_ship_same_ship
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when the other ship is the same ship, the function is_ship_overlap should return True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the same ship object as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies when the other ship is the same ship, which is considered an overlap. This is important for the game logic to prevent a ship from being placed on top of itself.
