Scenario 1: Test when two ships do not overlap
Details:
  TestName: test_ships_do_not_overlap
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when two ships do not share any common coordinates, the function is_ship_overlap should return False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two ship objects such that they do not share any common coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the second ship as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately identifies when two ships do not overlap. Ensuring this functionality is crucial for the game logic to prevent placing ships on top of each other.

Scenario 2: Test when two ships do overlap
Details:
  TestName: test_ships_do_overlap
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when two ships share at least one common coordinate, the function is_ship_overlap should return True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two ship objects such that they share at least one common coordinate.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the second ship as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly identifies when two ships overlap. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of the game board and ensuring fair play.

Scenario 3: Test when the other ship type does not match
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_type_mismatch
  Description: This test is intended to verify that when the other ship is not of the same type, the function is_ship_overlap raises a ValueError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object and another object of a different type.
  Act: Invoke the function is_ship_overlap with the different type object as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly identifies and responds to a type mismatch. This is important as only objects of the same type should be compared for overlap, ensuring the integrity and consistency of the game logic.
