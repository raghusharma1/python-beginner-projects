Scenario 1: Test for No Coordinates Provided
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_with_no_coordinates
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises an InvalidShipCoordinateException when no coordinates are provided for the ship's position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object with an empty list as coordinates.
  Act: The _check_ship_coordinates function will be invoked during the initialization of the ship object.
  Assert: Check that an InvalidShipCoordinateException is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that a ship cannot be created without any coordinates, in line with the specifications and business requirements of the game.

Scenario 2: Test for Negative Coordinates
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_with_negative_coordinates
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises an InvalidShipCoordinateException when the ship's coordinates have negative values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object with coordinates that have negative values.
  Act: The _check_ship_coordinates function will be invoked during the initialization of the ship object.
  Assert: Check that an InvalidShipCoordinateException is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the ship's coordinates must be positive, aligning with the business requirement that the game board's coordinates start from zero.

Scenario 3: Test for Non-Constant Rows and Columns
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_with_non_constant_rows_and_columns
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises an InvalidShipCoordinateException when neither the rows nor the columns of the ship's coordinates have constant values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object with coordinates where neither the rows nor the columns have constant values.
  Act: The _check_ship_coordinates function will be invoked during the initialization of the ship object.
  Assert: Check that an InvalidShipCoordinateException is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that a ship must be placed either horizontally or vertically on the game board, as per the business requirements.

Scenario 4: Test for Duplicate Coordinates
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_with_duplicate_coordinates
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises an InvalidShipCoordinateException when there are duplicate coordinates for the ship's position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object with duplicate coordinates.
  Act: The _check_ship_coordinates function will be invoked during the initialization of the ship object.
  Assert: Check that an InvalidShipCoordinateException is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that each coordinate on the game board can only be occupied by one part of a ship, in line with the business requirements.

Scenario 5: Test for Non-Consecutive Coordinates
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_with_non_consecutive_coordinates
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function raises an AssertionError when the non-constant row/column of the ship's coordinates is not in consecutive order.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a ship object with non-consecutive coordinates.
  Act: The _check_ship_coordinates function will be invoked during the initialization of the ship object.
  Assert: Check that an AssertionError is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that a ship's coordinates must be in consecutive order, representing the fact that a ship occupies consecutive spaces on the game board.
