Scenario 1: Verify that the function correctly prints the player's current battlefield situation.
Details:
  TestName: test_print_player_battlefield_situation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly prints the battlefield situation from the perspective of the specified player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Player objects, player and other_player. Initialize their enemy_board attributes with Board objects containing some Ships.
  Act: Invoke the function print_player_board with player and other_player as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the printed output contains the player's name followed by "Battlefield Situation" and the correct representation of the player's battlefield.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly represents the player's current battlefield situation, which is crucial for the players to understand the state of the game.

Scenario 2: Verify that the function correctly prints the player's targets.
Details:
  TestName: test_print_player_targets
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly prints the targets from the perspective of the specified player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Player objects, player and other_player. Initialize their enemy_board attributes with Board objects containing some Ships.
  Act: Invoke the function print_player_board with player and other_player as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the printed output contains the player's name followed by "Targets" and the correct representation of the player's targets.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly represents the player's targets, which is crucial for the players to strategize their next moves.

Scenario 3: Verify that the function handles the case where the boards are empty.
Details:
  TestName: test_print_player_board_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the case where the player's and the other player's boards are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Player objects, player and other_player. Initialize their enemy_board attributes with empty Board objects.
  Act: Invoke the function print_player_board with player and other_player as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the printed output contains the player's name followed by "Battlefield Situation" and "Targets", and that the representations of the battlefield and targets are empty.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where the boards are empty, which is important for the initial state of the game or situations where all ships have been destroyed.
