Scenario 1: Verify that the function correctly prints the player's current battlefield situation.
Details:
  TestName: test_print_player_battlefield_situation
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly prints the battlefield situation from the perspective of the specified player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Player objects, player and other_player. Initialize their enemy_board attributes with Board objects containing some Ships.
  Act: Invoke the function print_player_board with player and other_player as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the printed output contains the correct battlefield situation for the player.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the player is provided with an accurate representation of their current battlefield situation. This is crucial for the player to make informed decisions during gameplay.

Scenario 2: Verify that the function correctly prints the player's targets.
Details:
  TestName: test_print_player_targets
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly prints the targets (i.e., enemy board) from the perspective of the specified player.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Player objects, player and other_player. Initialize their enemy_board attributes with Board objects containing some Ships.
  Act: Invoke the function print_player_board with player and other_player as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the printed output contains the correct target (enemy board) situation for the player.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the player is provided with an accurate representation of their current targets (enemy board). This is crucial for the player to make informed decisions about where to attack next during gameplay.

Scenario 3: Verify that the function correctly handles empty boards.
Details:
  TestName: test_print_empty_boards
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles the situation where both players' boards are empty (i.e., contain no ships).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two Player objects, player and other_player. Initialize their enemy_board attributes with empty Board objects.
  Act: Invoke the function print_player_board with player and other_player as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the printed output correctly represents the empty battlefield and target situations.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly handle edge cases where the boards are empty. This is crucial for the game to function correctly from the start, when no ships have been placed yet, or towards the end, when nearly all ships have been destroyed.
