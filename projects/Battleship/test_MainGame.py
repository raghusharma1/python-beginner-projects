Scenario 1: Test if the game starts correctly when the user inputs "yes" or "y"
Details:
  TestName: test_start_game_yes
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the game starts correctly when the user inputs "yes" or "y" during the prompt.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to "yes" or "y".
  Act: Invoke the new_game() function.
  Assert: Check if the board of the correct size is created and the game() function is invoked.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the game starts correctly when the user wants to play. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement of starting when the user agrees.

Scenario 2: Test if the game exits correctly when the user inputs "no" or "n"
Details:
  TestName: test_start_game_no
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the game exits correctly when the user inputs "no" or "n" during the prompt.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to "no" or "n".
  Act: Invoke the new_game() function.
  Assert: Check if the game quits without invoking the game() function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the game exits correctly when the user doesn't want to play. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement of terminating when the user disagrees.

Scenario 3: Test if the game handles incorrect inputs during the game start prompt
Details:
  TestName: test_start_game_incorrect_input
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the game can handle incorrect inputs during the game start prompt.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to an incorrect value.
  Act: Invoke the new_game() function.
  Assert: Check if the new_game() function is invoked again for a new prompt.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the game can handle incorrect inputs during the start and asks for input again. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement of handling incorrect inputs.

Scenario 4: Test if the battleship is placed randomly on the board
Details:
  TestName: test_random_battleship_placement
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the battleship is placed randomly on the board each game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Start multiple games.
  Act: Invoke the game() function multiple times.
  Assert: Check if the position of the battleship varies between games.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the game is different each time the user plays. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement of random placement of the battleship.

Scenario 5: Test if the user can win the game by guessing the correct position
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_guess
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the user can win the game by guessing the correct position of the battleship.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to the correct position of the battleship.
  Act: Invoke the game() function.
  Assert: Check if the game ends with the user winning.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the game can be won by guessing the correct position. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement of allowing the user to win by guessing the correct position.

Scenario 6: Test if the game handles incorrect guess inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_guess_input
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the game can handle incorrect guess inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's guess input to an incorrect value.
  Act: Invoke the game() function.
  Assert: Check if the game asks for the guess again.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the game can handle incorrect guess inputs and asks for a new guess. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement of handling incorrect guess inputs.
