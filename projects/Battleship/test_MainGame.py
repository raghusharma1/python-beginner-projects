```
Scenario 1: Test the successful start of a new game
Details:
  TestName: test_new_game_start
  Description: This test validates the successful initiation of a new game when the user inputs "yes" or "y".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return "yes".
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly prompts for the board size.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game can be started successfully with the correct user input.

Scenario 2: Test refusing to start a new game
Details:
  TestName: test_no_new_game
  Description: This test validates the termination of the game when the user inputs "no" or "n".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return "no".
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly exits the game.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game can be ended successfully with the correct user input.

Scenario 3: Test the creation of a valid game board
Details:
  TestName: test_board_creation
  Description: This test validates the creation of a game board of valid size, as input by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return "yes" and a valid board size.
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly creates a game board of the specified size.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game board is created with the correct size as per user input.

Scenario 4: Test successful ship placement
Details:
  TestName: test_ship_placement
  Description: This test verifies that the battleship is placed at a random location within the game board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock game board.
  Act: Call the game function.
  Assert: Check if the ship has been placed within the board boundaries.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the battleship is correctly and randomly positioned within the game board, which is crucial for the game's functionality.

Scenario 5: Test successful game win
Details:
  TestName: test_game_win
  Description: This test verifies that the game is won when the user correctly guesses the ship's position.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return the correct ship position.
  Act: Call the game function.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly identifies the win and restarts the game.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game correctly identifies a win scenario, which is fundamental to the game's functionality and user experience.

Scenario 6: Test unsuccessful game play
Details:
  TestName: test_game_loss
  Description: This test verifies that the game is lost when the user fails to guess the ship's position within the given turns.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return incorrect ship positions.
  Act: Call the game function.
  Assert: Check if the function correctly identifies the loss and restarts the game.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game correctly identifies a loss scenario, which is essential for the game's functionality and user experience.
