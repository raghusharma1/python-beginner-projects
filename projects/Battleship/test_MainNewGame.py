Scenario 1: Successful start of a new game
Details:
  TestName: test_start_new_game
  Description: This test verifies that the game successfully starts when "yes" or "y" is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return "yes" or "y" and a valid board size between 5 and 15.
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check that the board size is set correctly and game function is called.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the game starts correctly when the user wants to play. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement to start a new game when the user inputs "yes" or "y".

Scenario 2: Successful denial of a new game
Details:
  TestName: test_deny_new_game
  Description: This test verifies that the game does not start when "no" or "n" is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return "no" or "n".
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check that the game function is not called and the program is intended to quit.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game does not start when the user does not want to play. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement to not start a new game when the user inputs "no" or "n".

Scenario 3: Invalid input for starting a new game
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_new_game
  Description: This test verifies that the new_game function is called again when an invalid input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return an invalid input and then "yes" and a valid board size.
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check that the new_game function is called twice and the game starts with the correct board size.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles invalid inputs correctly by asking again. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement to handle invalid inputs for starting a new game.

Scenario 4: Invalid input for board size
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_board_size
  Description: This test verifies that the user is asked again for the board size when an invalid input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return "yes", an invalid board size, and then a valid board size.
  Act: Call the new_game function.
  Assert: Check that the user is asked for the board size twice and the game starts with the correct board size.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles invalid inputs for the board size correctly by asking again. The expected result aligns with the game's requirement to handle invalid board sizes by asking the user again.
