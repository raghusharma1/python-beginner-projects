Scenario 1: Test for New Game Initiation Confirmation
Details:
  TestName: test_new_game_confirmation
  Description: This test is intended to verify the user's response when asked to start a new game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to simulate a user input of 'yes' or 'y'.
  Act: Invoke the new_game function.
  Assert: Check if the function proceeds to ask for the board size.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the game's ability to respond correctly to user confirmation for starting a new game, which is a fundamental requirement for the game to function.

Scenario 2: Test for Board Size Input
Details:
  TestName: test_board_size_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify the user's input for the board size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to simulate a user input of a valid number between 5 and 15.
  Act: Invoke the new_game function after the user has confirmed to start a new game.
  Assert: Check if the function creates a board of the specified size.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the game's ability to correctly interpret and implement the user's input for the board size, which affects the game's difficulty and duration.

Scenario 3: Test for Game Exit Confirmation
Details:
  TestName: test_game_exit_confirmation
  Description: This test is intended to verify the user's response when asked to start a new game and chooses not to.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to simulate a user input of 'no' or 'n'.
  Act: Invoke the new_game function.
  Assert: Check if the function proceeds to end the game.
Validation:
  This test verifies the game's ability to correctly close itself when the user does not want to play. This is an essential feature for user experience and control over the game.

Scenario 4: Test for Invalid Board Size Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_board_size_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify the situation where the user inputs an invalid number for the board size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to simulate a user input of an invalid number outside the range of 5 to 15.
  Act: Invoke the new_game function after the user has confirmed to start a new game.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ValueError and asks for a valid input.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the game's ability to handle invalid inputs and prompt the user for a valid input, ensuring the game's robustness and user-friendliness.

Scenario 5: Test for Invalid New Game Confirmation Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_new_game_confirmation
  Description: This test is intended to verify the situation where the user inputs an invalid response when asked to start a new game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to simulate a user input of an invalid response that is neither 'yes', 'y', 'no', nor 'n'.
  Act: Invoke the new_game function.
  Assert: Check if the function asks the user for a valid input again.
Validation:
  This test is critical as it verifies the game's ability to handle invalid inputs and prompt the user for a valid response, improving the game's robustness and user-friendliness.
