Scenario 1: Test with a populated board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_populated_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of a populated board.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing a populated board is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the populated board as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected output is a string representation of the board, and it is compared with the output of the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly prints a board that is already populated, which is a common use case for this function.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of an empty board.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing an empty board is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the empty board as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected output is an empty string, and it is compared with the output of the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and prints an empty board, which is a less common but still possible use case for this function.

Scenario 3: Test with a board containing non-string values
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_non_string_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of a board that contains non-string values.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing a board with non-string values is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the board containing non-string values as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected output is a string representation of the board, with all non-string values converted to strings, and it is compared with the output of the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and prints a board containing non-string values, which could occur if the board's values are programmatically generated.

Scenario 4: Test with a board of varying row lengths
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_varying_row_lengths
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of a board that contains rows of varying lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing a board with varying row lengths is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the board of varying row lengths as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected output is a string representation of the board, with each row printed on a new line, and it is compared with the output of the function.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles and prints a board where rows have different lengths, which could occur if the board's structure is not perfectly rectangular.
