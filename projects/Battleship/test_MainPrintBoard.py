Scenario 1: Test with a populated board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_populated_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of a populated board.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing a populated board is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the populated board as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected string output is compared to the actual output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly print a populated board. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it is expected that the function should be able to handle printing populated boards.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of an empty board.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing an empty board is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the empty board as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected string output is compared to the actual output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly print an empty board. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it is expected that the function should be able to handle printing empty boards.

Scenario 3: Test with a board of varying row lengths
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_varying_row_lengths
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of a board with varying row lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing a board with varying row lengths is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the board as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected string output is compared to the actual output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly print a board with rows of varying lengths. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it is expected that the function should be able to handle printing boards of differing dimensions.

Scenario 4: Test with a board containing special characters
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_special_characters
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct printing of a board containing special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D list representing a board with special characters is created.
  Act: The function print_board is invoked with the board as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected string output is compared to the actual output.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can correctly print a board containing special characters. The expected result aligns with the function's specifications and business requirements, as it is expected that the function should be able to handle printing boards with a variety of content.
