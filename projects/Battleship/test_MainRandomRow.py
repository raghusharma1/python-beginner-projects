Scenario 1: Test with a non-empty board.
Details:
  TestName: test_random_row_with_non_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function random_row returns a valid index for a non-empty board. The board is represented as a list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a non-empty board (list).
  Act: Call the function random_row with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: The returned value should be between 0 and len(board) - 1 (inclusive).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly generates a random index within the valid range for a non-empty board. This is crucial for the function's specifications and the business requirements, as it ensures that any row can be randomly selected.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty board.
Details:
  TestName: test_random_row_with_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function random_row behaves as expected when provided with an empty board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty board (empty list).
  Act: Call the function random_row with the empty board as a parameter.
  Assert: The function should raise a ValueError, as the board is empty and there are no valid indices.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles edge cases correctly, in this case when the board is empty. The expected outcome is in line with the function's specifications and business requirements, as an empty board should not have any selectable rows.

Scenario 3: Test with a large board.
Details:
  TestName: test_random_row_with_large_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function random_row can handle large boards and still return a valid index.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large board (a large list).
  Act: Call the function random_row with the large board as a parameter.
  Assert: The returned value should be between 0 and len(board) - 1 (inclusive).
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large inputs, a requirement in scenarios with many rows. This is crucial for the function's specifications and the business requirements, as it ensures that any row can be randomly selected, regardless of the board size.
