Scenario 1: Test with a non-empty board.
Details:
  TestName: test_random_row_with_non_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function random_row returns a valid index for a non-empty board. The board's size is not predefined, so the function should work with any size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with a known size.
  Act: Invoke the function random_row with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned index is within the valid range for the board (0 to len(board) - 1).
Validation:
  The function is expected to return a random index within the valid range. The test verifies this behavior ensuring that the function works correctly with non-empty boards.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty board.
Details:
  TestName: test_random_row_with_empty_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function random_row handles an empty board correctly. An empty board should be considered a valid scenario, but since it has no rows, the function should not be able to return a valid index.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty board.
  Act: Invoke the function random_row with the empty board as a parameter.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised, as there are no valid indices for an empty board.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function handles edge cases correctly. An empty board is a valid scenario, and the function should not crash or return an invalid index. Instead, it should raise an exception, indicating that there are no valid rows to return.

Scenario 3: Test with a large board.
Details:
  TestName: test_random_row_with_large_board
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function random_row can handle a large board. The function should not show any performance issues or crashes due to the size of the board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large board.
  Act: Invoke the function random_row with the large board as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned index is within the valid range for the board (0 to len(board) - 1).
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle any size of board, including large ones. This test verifies that the function does not show any performance issues or crashes when working with large boards.
