### Test Scenarios for `display_scoreboard` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify standard output for positive scores
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_positive_scores
  Description: Verify that the function correctly formats and prints the scores for both players when provided with positive integer scores.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score to 50 and player2_score to 75, with over set to 5.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(50, 75, 5).
  Assert: Capture the output using a patch on the print function and verify the output matches the expected text.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function handles typical use cases where both players have positive scores, correctly displays the over number, and maintains proper formatting in the output.

#### Scenario 2: Verify output when scores are zero
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: Ensure that the function handles cases where both scores are zero, which is a valid scenario especially at the beginning of a game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both player1_score and player2_score to 0, with over set to 0.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(0, 0, 0).
  Assert: Check that the output correctly displays zero scores for both players.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can correctly represent a game's start or a scenario where no points have been scored, which is critical for accurate game tracking.

#### Scenario 3: Verify output formatting with high over numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_high_over_number
  Description: Test the function's ability to correctly handle and display large numbers for the over, ensuring the output format remains consistent.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score to 20, player2_score to 30, and over to 99.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(20, 30, 99).
  Assert: Ensure that the output correctly reflects the high over number without formatting issues.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the output format when dealing with large over numbers, ensuring usability and clarity regardless of game length.

#### Scenario 4: Verify output when scores are negative
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_negative_scores
  Description: Ensure that the function can technically handle negative scores, which might be used in special testing or error scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score to -10 and player2_score to -5, with over set to 3.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(-10, -5, 3).
  Assert: Verify that the output correctly displays negative values.
Validation:
  Although negative scores are not typical in standard gameplay, this test ensures that the function can handle and display such values, which might be useful for specific game rules or error tracking.

### Comprehensive Audit Guidelines for Test Cases of the Provided Python `display_scoreboard` Function
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Compilation-Ready Tests**: Ensure all test cases are written with correct syntax and follow Python's naming conventions. Use libraries like `unittest.mock` to patch and capture the output of the `print` function.
2. **Error Handling**: While the function does not currently throw errors, tests should be prepared to handle any modifications that might introduce exceptions or errors. Use try-except blocks where appropriate to catch unexpected behaviors.
3. **Output Validation**: Use output capturing to validate what the function prints. This ensures that not only the logic but also the presentation layer meets the requirements.
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Include tests for edge cases such as extremely high or low scores and overs. This ensures the function is robust under various scenarios.
5. **Documentation and Comments**: Each test should be well-documented explaining its purpose, setup, and expected outcomes. This is crucial for maintaining tests and understanding their scope and impact.
6. **Consistency in Testing Approach**: Maintain a consistent structure for all tests, using Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. This promotes readability and maintainability.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios ensure a comprehensive testing approach that thoroughly validates the functionality and robustness of the `display_scoreboard` function.
