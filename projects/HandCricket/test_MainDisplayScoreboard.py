### Scenario 1: Basic Score Display
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_score_display
  Description: Verify that the function correctly formats and prints the scores of both players along with the over number when provided with non-negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare player1_score, player2_score, and over as non-negative integers.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with the prepared scores and over.
  Assert: Confirm that the output matches the expected format, including correct player scores and over number.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function can handle typical inputs and produce a correctly formatted output, which is fundamental for user understanding and correct display of game progress.

### Scenario 2: Zero Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_scores
  Description: Validate the function's ability to handle cases where both players have a score of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both player1_score and player2_score to 0, with any valid over number.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the output correctly displays "Player 1: 0 runs" and "Player 2: 0 runs".
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can correctly handle the edge case of zero scores, which is important for games that may start or have rounds where no points are scored.

### Scenario 3: High Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_high_scores
  Description: Test the function's performance and output correctness under high score values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score and player2_score with unusually high values (e.g., in the thousands), and a valid over number.
  Act: Invoke display_scoreboard with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the output correctly displays the high scores without truncation or formatting errors.
Validation:
  High score scenarios are important to ensure that the display function can handle large numbers, which might occur in extended or high-scoring games.

### Scenario 4: Incremental Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_incremental_overs
  Description: Confirm that the function correctly increments and displays the over number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a base over number and increment it in subsequent calls to the function.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard multiple times with incrementing over values.
  Assert: Verify that each call correctly updates and displays the incremented over number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can dynamically update and display game progress across different stages, which is essential for real-time game tracking.

### Scenario 5: Negative Scores Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_scores
  Description: Check how the function handles negative scores, which might be input due to errors in other parts of the application.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide negative values for player1_score and/or player2_score and a valid over number.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with these parameters.
  Assert: Observe how the function handles the negative values, whether it displays them directly or handles them in some way.
Validation:
  Testing negative score inputs is important for identifying potential error handling capabilities or weaknesses in the function, ensuring robustness in face of incorrect input data.

### Scenario 6: Non-Integer Over
Details:
  TestName: test_non_integer_over
  Description: Examine the function's response to receiving a non-integer over value, such as a string or a float.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a non-integer value for over, while keeping player scores as valid integers.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with these parameters.
  Assert: Check how the function manages a non-integer over value.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial to understanding how strictly the function enforces the data type of the over parameter, potentially identifying type-related bugs or the need for type checking in the function.
