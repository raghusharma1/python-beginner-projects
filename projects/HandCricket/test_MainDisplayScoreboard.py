Scenario 1: Validate display of the scoreboard with positive scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_positive_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when all the inputs are positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with positive integer values.
  Act: Invoke the display_scoreboard function with the initialized values.
  Assert: Check if the output string matches the expected scoreboard display.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the function correctly displays the scores and over when all inputs are positive. This is a basic functionality of the function as per its specifications.

Scenario 2: Validate display of the scoreboard with zero scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when all the inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with 0.
  Act: Invoke the display_scoreboard function with the initialized values.
  Assert: Check if the output string matches the expected scoreboard display.
Validation:
  It's important to verify that the function correctly handles the edge case of zero scores and over, as it's a valid scenario in a cricket match.

Scenario 3: Validate display of the scoreboard with negative scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_negative_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when the inputs are negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with negative integer values.
  Act: Invoke the display_scoreboard function with the initialized values.
  Assert: Check if the output string matches the expected scoreboard display.
Validation:
  Although negative scores and over are not valid in a real-world scenario, it's important to check how the function handles such inputs. This test helps identify any unexpected behavior or potential errors in the function.

Scenario 4: Validate display of the scoreboard with large scores and over
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_large_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct display of the scores and over when the inputs are large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score, player2_score, and over with large integer values.
  Act: Invoke the display_scoreboard function with the initialized values.
  Assert: Check if the output string matches the expected scoreboard display.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly display large scores and over, which is crucial for ensuring its robustness and scalability.
