### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality with Zero Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: Tests the function with both scores set to zero and a specific over number, verifying that it correctly formats and displays the output.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare player1_score = 0, player2_score = 0, over = 0.
  Act: Call the function `display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over)`.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected strings for the zero scores and the correct over number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the minimal edge case of zero scores correctly. It's important as it tests the function's ability to handle and display the lowest possible valid scores.

### Scenario 2: High Scores and Advanced Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_high_scores
  Description: Verify that the function handles large score values and a higher over number properly, displaying them accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score = 150, player2_score = 130, over = 49.
  Act: Invoke `display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over)`.
  Assert: Validate that the output correctly reflects the high scores and the specified over number.
Validation:
  This scenario is important for ensuring that the function can handle and display high scores without errors. It verifies that the function works correctly under scenarios of high game activity.

### Scenario 3: Negative Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_negative_over
  Description: Checks how the function behaves if provided a negative over number, which is typically an invalid scenario in cricket.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player1_score = 20, player2_score = 30, over = -1.
  Act: Execute `display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over)`.
  Assert: Ensure the output reflects the negative over number correctly, even though it's an unusual scenario.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for identifying how the function handles unexpected or invalid input values. It helps in ensuring robustness by handling cases that deviate from the normal domain of the function (cricket games typically do not have negative overs).

### Scenario 4: Sequential Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_sequential_overs
  Description: Test the function's output consistency by simulating multiple sequential overs and ensuring the function increments and displays overs accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a loop to simulate scores and overs, e.g., [(10, 20, 0), (15, 25, 1), (20, 30, 2)].
  Act: In a loop, call `display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over)` for each tuple.
  Assert: Check that each call results in the correct over number and scores being displayed.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function maintains state accuracy over sequential calls, which is essential for real-time applications like displaying scores in a live cricket match scenario.

### Scenario 5: Identical Scores for Both Players
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_identical_scores
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly handles and displays the scenario where both players have identical scores.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score = 50, player2_score = 50, over = 10.
  Act: Call `display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over)`.
  Assert: Confirm that the output correctly shows identical scores for both players.
Validation:
  Testing identical scores is important to ensure that the function does not differentiate incorrectly or display biased information when both players have the same score. This test helps in confirming the neutrality and accuracy of the display logic.
