Certainly! Here are the test scenarios for the `display_scoreboard` function:

### Scenario 1: Basic Score Display
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_basic_scores
  Description: Test the display of a standard scoreboard output when both players have scored some runs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score to 10 and player2_score to 20, and over to 5.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with the arranged scores and over.
  Assert: Check if the output matches the expected format and values.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly formats and displays the scores and over number. It ensures the basic functionality meets the specifications for displaying scores in a readable format.

### Scenario 2: Zero Score Display
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when both players have a score of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score and player2_score to 0, and over to 3.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with the arranged scores and over.
  Assert: Check if the output correctly shows zero runs for both players.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy in situations where no runs have been scored, which is crucial for correct score reporting from the beginning of the game.

### Scenario 3: High Score Display
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_high_scores
  Description: Ensure the function handles and displays high scores correctly without errors or formatting issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score to 150 and player2_score to 200, and over to 10.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with the arranged scores and over.
  Assert: Check if the output handles larger numbers correctly and maintains proper formatting.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is capable of handling and correctly displaying high scores, which is essential for games with higher scoring.

### Scenario 4: Negative Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_negative_over
  Description: Test how the function handles a negative over number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player1_score to 10, player2_score to 20, and over to -1.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with the arranged scores and over.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the negative over gracefully and displays it as given.
Validation:
  While a negative over number might not be typical, this test ensures that the function does not fail unexpectedly and can handle unexpected input gracefully.

### Scenario 5: Incremental Over Display
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_incremental_overs
  Description: Confirm that the function displays sequential overs correctly when called multiple times for consecutive overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set initial scores and call the function for overs 0, 1, and 2 sequentially.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard consecutively with increasing overs.
  Assert: Check if each call correctly increments and displays the over number.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's reliability in a use case where the scoreboard needs to be updated across multiple overs, ensuring consistent performance over time.

Each of these scenarios tests a different aspect of the `display_scoreboard` function, helping to ensure that it works correctly under various conditions and inputs.
