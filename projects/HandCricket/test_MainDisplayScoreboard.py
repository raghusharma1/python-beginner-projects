### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality with Zero Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly displays scores when both players have a score of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required other than parameters.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(0, 0, 0).
  Assert: Check that the output includes "Player 1: 0 runs" and "Player 2: 0 runs".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately reports scenarios where no points have been scored, a common case especially at the beginning of a game.

### Scenario 2: Incrementing Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_incrementing_overs
  Description: Ensures the function handles and displays the incrementing overs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required other than parameters.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with increasing values for the 'over' parameter (e.g., over=0, over=1, etc.).
  Assert: Check that the output correctly reflects the incremented over in the format "Over X:" where X is the incremented over number.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function can handle and display a sequence of overs, which is critical for tracking the progress of a game over multiple rounds.

### Scenario 3: High Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_high_scores
  Description: Tests the function's ability to handle and correctly display high scores, which could be typical in a high-scoring game scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required other than parameters.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with high values for scores (e.g., player1_score=300, player2_score=275).
  Assert: Verify that the output correctly displays the high scores without truncation or formatting issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's reliability and accuracy in scenarios where the game scores are unusually high, verifying that score digits do not get truncated or misformatted.

### Scenario 4: Negative Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_negative_scores
  Description: Verifies that the function can handle and display negative scores, even though they are not typical in standard games.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required other than parameters.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with negative values (e.g., player1_score=-10, player2_score=-20).
  Assert: Check that the output correctly displays the negative scores.
Validation:
  While negative scores are not common, this test checks the robustness of the function in handling and displaying such values, which might be used in error handling or specific game types.

### Scenario 5: Large Increment in Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_large_over_increment
  Description: Tests the function's ability to handle and display a large jump in the number of overs, skipping several overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required other than parameters.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard with a large value for the 'over' parameter (e.g., over=50).
  Assert: Verify that the output correctly displays the large over number.
Validation:
  This test is important for validating that the function can handle game scenarios where several overs might be simulated or skipped without actual play, ensuring the display logic remains accurate regardless of the over sequence.
