### Scenario 1: Basic Score Display
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_score_display
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly formats and displays scores for both players and the current over when provided with typical positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare player scores and over number.
  Act: Call the `display_scoreboard` function with sample scores for player1 and player2, and an over number.
  Assert: Use a method to capture printed output and verify that it matches the expected format and content.
Validation:
  Rationalizing this test is important as it ensures that the function behaves as expected under normal conditions, displaying scores and over information correctly, which is crucial for user understanding during live gameplay scenarios.

### Scenario 2: Display with Zero Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_scores_display
  Description: Ensures that the scoreboard correctly displays a score of zero for both players.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both player1_score and player2_score to 0, and any valid over number.
  Act: Invoke `display_scoreboard` with these parameters.
  Assert: Capture the output and confirm that the scores are represented as "0 runs" correctly.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function can handle and accurately display scenarios where no points have been scored, which is possible at the beginning of a game or in cases of strong defense.

### Scenario 3: Negative Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_over_display
  Description: Tests the function's response to a negative over number, which might be an edge case in the logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid scores and a negative over number.
  Act: Call `display_scoreboard` with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the output correctly includes the negative over number, reflecting it accurately in the format.
Validation:
  While typically not expected in standard gameplay, testing with a negative over number ensures robustness in the function's handling of input and helps in identifying potential areas of improvement in input validation.

### Scenario 4: High Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_high_scores_display
  Description: Checks the function's ability to handle and correctly display unusually high scores, testing its capacity to handle a range of integer inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input extremely high scores for both players and a typical over number.
  Act: Execute `display_scoreboard` with these high values.
  Assert: Validate that the output correctly displays these high scores without formatting issues.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function can appropriately handle and display large numbers, which is essential for ensuring usability and accuracy in record-breaking or extended gameplay situations.

### Scenario 5: Sequential Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_sequential_overs_display
  Description: Verifies that the function increments and displays overs correctly across sequential calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call the function multiple times with incrementing over values.
  Act: In each call, increment the over number and maintain consistent scores.
  Assert: Ensure each output correctly reflects the incremented over number.
Validation:
  Testing sequential overs is crucial to confirm that the function maintains consistency and accuracy in a live game scenario where overs increment naturally. This helps in maintaining the integrity of the game's progress in the display logic.
