### Test Scenarios for `display_scoreboard`

#### Scenario 1: Valid Scores and Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_valid_inputs
  Description: Verify that the function correctly formats and displays the scores and over number for valid input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define player scores and over number, e.g., player1_score = 100, player2_score = 150, over = 5.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over).
  Assert: Check that the output matches the expected string format.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles typical valid inputs correctly and displays them as expected, adhering to the business requirements of accurately reporting game scores.

#### Scenario 2: Zero Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_zero_scores
  Description: Test the function with zero scores to confirm that it handles low boundary conditions without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set both player scores to 0 and a valid over number, e.g., over = 3.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(0, 0, over).
  Assert: Confirm that the output correctly indicates zero scores for both players.
Validation:
  Checks the function's robustness in handling the minimal edge case for scores, ensuring clarity in score reporting even when no points have been scored.

#### Scenario 3: Negative Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_negative_over
  Description: Verify the function's output when provided with a negative over number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define valid player scores and a negative over number, e.g., player1_score = 85, player2_score = 90, over = -1.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over).
  Assert: Check that the output correctly displays the over as "Over 0:".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can gracefully handle incorrect input for the over number, defaulting to a sensible output that maintains logical consistency in scoreboard display.

#### Scenario 4: High Scores and Over Number
Details:
  TestName: test_display_scoreboard_high_scores_and_over
  Description: Test the function with unusually high scores and over number to assess its handling of upper boundary conditions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player scores and over number to high values, e.g., player1_score = 10000, player2_score = 12000, over = 50.
  Act: Call display_scoreboard(player1_score, player2_score, over).
  Assert: Ensure the output correctly reflects these high values without formatting issues.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle large numbers without errors, crucial for scenarios with extended gameplay or record-breaking performances.

### BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**: 
- Ensure the output string correctly formats and displays all inputs, including scores and over numbers. The function should accurately reflect the state of the game based on the inputs provided.

**Boundary Conditions**: 
- Test with zero and extremely high values for scores and over numbers. Verify that the function does not crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Error Handling**: 
- Although Python is dynamically typed, consider testing with non-integer types in an extended version to observe behavior, even though we avoid this in initial tests per guidelines. Check how the function handles negative integers for the over number, ensuring it defaults to a logical output.

**Performance**: 
- This function primarily handles output based on given inputs and does not involve complex computations or large data sets. Performance testing might focus on the efficiency of string operations under normal conditions.

**Security**: 
- As a display function, security concerns might focus on ensuring that the function does not execute or evaluate any input as code (no eval functions or similar vulnerabilities).
END_GUIDELINE

Note: All scenarios assume the function's primary role is to format and display data without returning it, which aligns with the behavior observed in the provided function definition.
