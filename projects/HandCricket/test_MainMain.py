### Scenario 1: Valid input scenario with Player 1 winning the toss and choosing to bat first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player1_bats_first
  Description: This test verifies that the game flow proceeds correctly when Player 1 wins the toss, chooses to bat first, and inputs are valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for the number of overs, toss outcome, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the correct messages are printed, including "Player 1 won the toss!" and the appropriate game results based on the mocked game logic.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game initializes and processes a valid scenario correctly, adhering to the rules and expected game flow, which is crucial for user experience and game integrity.

### Scenario 2: Valid input scenario with Player 2 winning the toss and choosing to bowl first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player2_bowls_first
  Description: This test checks the game's behavior when Player 2 wins the toss, chooses to bowl first, and all inputs are valid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the necessary inputs to simulate the scenario.
  Act: Execute the `main` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Validate that the game processes the inputs correctly and displays the expected outputs, such as "Player 2 won the toss!".
Validation:
  Validates that the game logic handles different valid game flows correctly, maintaining the game's fairness and functionality.

### Scenario 3: Handling of invalid overs input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Tests how the game handles a non-integer input for overs, which should trigger an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for overs with a non-integer value.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the game prints "Invalid input, exiting game" and terminates without proceeding further.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness in user input handling, preventing the game from proceeding with invalid data, which could lead to undefined behavior or crashes.

### Scenario 4: Handling of invalid difficulty input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Tests the game's response to a non-integer input for the difficulty level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid inputs for overs and toss but an invalid difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: The function should recognize the invalid input and print "Invalid input, exiting game".
Validation:
  This test is critical for ensuring that the game handles erroneous inputs gracefully, maintaining a good user experience and preventing potential exploits or crashes.

### Scenario 5: Testing edge case for minimum input values
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_input_values
  Description: Verifies the game's behavior with the minimum valid inputs for overs and difficulty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set overs to 1 and difficulty to 1, with valid toss and player choices.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the game completes successfully without errors and results are displayed correctly.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the boundary conditions of the game settings, ensuring that the game logic functions correctly at its limits.

### Scenario 6: Testing edge case for maximum input values
Details:
  TestName: test_maximum_input_values
  Description: Checks how the game manages the maximum valid inputs for overs and difficulty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set overs to 10 and difficulty to 3, with valid toss and player choices.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Ensure the game processes these inputs correctly and concludes properly.
Validation:
  Tests the upper boundaries for input values, confirming that the game can handle the full range of expected inputs without issue.

These scenarios collectively ensure comprehensive testing of the game's main function, covering both typical and edge cases to ensure robustness, correctness, and resilience in various situations.
