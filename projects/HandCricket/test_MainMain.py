### Scenario 1: Valid Input and Normal Execution
Details:
  TestName: test_main_normal_execution
  Description: This test checks if the main function handles valid inputs correctly, proceeds through all steps, and terminates without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input and random functions to provide controlled responses for number of overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the correct messages are printed and the game completes as expected.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the test is crucial as it ensures that the game functions as intended when provided with valid and expected inputs. This test verifies that the game logic flows correctly from start to finish under normal conditions.

### Scenario 2: Invalid Number of Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_main_invalid_overs
  Description: This test verifies that the main function correctly handles a scenario where the number of overs input is out of the valid range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide an invalid number of overs (e.g., 11).
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate error message is printed and the game does not proceed.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the game can gracefully handle user errors in input without crashing and provides clear feedback to the user, which is essential for good user experience.

### Scenario 3: Toss Winner Decision
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_winner_decision
  Description: This test ensures that the game correctly assigns who bats first based on the toss winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input and random functions to control the toss outcome and subsequent choices.
  Act: Call the `main` function with a predetermined winner of the toss.
  Assert: Verify that the game correctly assigns batting and bowling based on the toss outcome.
Validation:
  The test confirms the game's rules regarding toss outcomes and player choices, ensuring that the game adheres to the expected flow of cricket matches.

### Scenario 4: Difficulty Level Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_impact
  Description: This test checks whether the game correctly takes into account the difficulty level set by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input functions to set a specific difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function and observe how the game logic (in `play_game`) behaves differently.
  Assert: Check that the difficulty level affects game dynamics as expected (though specifics depend on the implementation of `play_game`).
Validation:
  Testing the impact of difficulty settings is essential to ensure that the game provides a scalable challenge to players, which is a key aspect of engaging game design.

### Scenario 5: Handling of Drawn Match
Details:
  TestName: test_drawn_match_handling
  Description: This test ensures that the game correctly identifies and handles a draw.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input and random functions to control the game outcome to ensure scores are equal.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game outputs the correct message for a draw.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's ability to correctly conclude matches where no player has a higher score. It is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game results and user satisfaction.
