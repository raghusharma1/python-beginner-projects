Scenario 1: Validate the game with correct inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_correct_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct flow of the game with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the inputs for the number of overs, player's choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function with pre-determined inputs.
  Assert: Check if the game runs without any exceptions and the score is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game functions as expected with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test the game with invalid number of overs
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_invalid_overs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the game's behavior with an invalid number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the inputs with an invalid number of overs.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the invalid input.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles invalid inputs correctly and throws the appropriate exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test the game with invalid player choices
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_invalid_player_choices
  Description: This test is intended to verify the game's behavior with invalid player choices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the inputs with invalid player choices.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the invalid choices.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles invalid player choices correctly and throws the appropriate exceptions.

Scenario 4: Test the game with invalid difficulty level
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_invalid_difficulty
  Description: This test is intended to verify the game's behavior with an invalid difficulty level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the inputs with an invalid difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the invalid difficulty level.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles invalid difficulty levels correctly and throws the appropriate exceptions.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Correctness: Ensure that the game behaves as expected with valid inputs and returns the correct score. Test different combinations of player choices and difficulty levels.

Boundary Conditions: Test the game with the minimum and maximum allowed number of overs. Also, test with the boundary values for the difficulty level.

Error Handling: Verify that the game throws the correct exceptions when provided with invalid inputs. This includes invalid number of overs, player choices, and difficulty level.

Performance: Test the game with the maximum allowed number of overs and the highest difficulty level. This will ensure that the game can handle the maximum load.

Security: Test the game with manipulated inputs to ensure that it doesn't lead to any breaches in data integrity or security.
