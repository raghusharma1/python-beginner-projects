### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Inputs and Normal Game Flow
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_game_flow
  Description: Verify that the game proceeds correctly when valid overs, difficulty, and toss choices are provided, and ensure the game concludes with the correct winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for overs, toss choices, and difficulty level. Mock the `play_game` and `toss` functions to return predetermined values.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the `who_won` function is called with the correct scores and that the game concludes without exceptions.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game logic is correctly integrating user inputs and game outcomes based on the rules defined in `play_game` and `who_won`.

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Overs Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Test how the game handles non-integer and out-of-range inputs for overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to provide invalid overs (like a string, a negative number, or a number greater than 10).
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the game exits or handles the error without proceeding to the toss.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the input validation for overs, ensuring that only valid game lengths are accepted, preventing game logic errors or crashes.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Difficulty Level Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Ensure the game handles invalid inputs for difficulty levels correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to provide invalid difficulty levels (such as non-integer values or integers outside the 1-3 range).
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game either defaults to a valid difficulty or exits gracefully.
Validation:
  Verifies that the game's difficulty setting adheres to expected constraints, enhancing user experience and preventing unexpected behaviors.

#### Scenario 4: Edge Case for Minimum and Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_overs
  Description: Ensure the game functions correctly at the boundary values of overs (1 and 10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for the minimum and maximum valid overs, with all other inputs valid.
  Act: Execute the `main` function twice, once with 1 over and once with 10 overs.
  Assert: Check that the game completes successfully and returns a result.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's handling of boundary conditions for overs, ensuring consistent performance and stability at edge values.

#### Scenario 5: Game Performance Under Maximum Stress
Details:
  TestName: test_game_performance_under_stress
  Description: Assess the performance and responsiveness of the game under maximum allowable overs and difficulty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set game parameters to maximum overs and highest difficulty, ensuring all other inputs are valid.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Observe and measure the response time and resource usage.
Validation:
  This test evaluates the efficiency and scalability of the game under high load, ensuring the game remains playable without significant delays or resource exhaustion.

### Testing Guidelines

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**: Tests should confirm that all game functions integrate and produce correct outcomes (e.g., correct winner based on scores). Mocking dependencies like `play_game` and `toss` can isolate the main function for focused testing.

**Boundary Conditions**: Include tests for the minimum and maximum valid inputs for overs and difficulty levels. These tests ensure that the game handles edge cases without errors.

**Error Handling**: Tests need to verify that the game gracefully handles invalid inputs by either rejecting them with an error message or by not proceeding with game logic that relies on these inputs.

**Performance**: Evaluate how the game performs with maximum input limits, focusing on response times and resource usage, to ensure the game remains efficient and responsive under load.

**Security**: While not heavily focused in this context, ensuring that input handling does not lead to unexpected behavior or crashes is crucial. This includes managing user inputs through the console and handling any exceptions that arise.
