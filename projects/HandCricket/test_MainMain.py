```
Scenario 1: Valid input flow with Player 1 winning the toss and choosing to bat first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player1_bats_first
  Description: This test verifies that the flow of the game proceeds correctly when player 1 wins the toss and opts to bat first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for number of overs, toss outcome, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the functions play_game and who_won are called with the correct parameters and that the output corresponds to this game flow.
Validation:
  Rationalize that ensuring the correct flow from toss to game end validates the game logic under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Edge case where the minimum number of overs (1) is played
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_overs_played
  Description: Tests the game's behavior when the minimum limit of overs (1 over) is chosen to verify the game handles short matches properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to simulate a 1-over match.
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: Verify that play_game function handles a 1-over game correctly and that the final scores are computed and displayed properly.
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test checks the system's stability and accuracy under the minimum load and edge condition.

Scenario 3: Maximum overs scenario where 10 overs are played
Details:
  TestName: test_maximum_overs_played
  Description: Ensures the game correctly handles the scenario where the maximum number of overs (10) is played.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for a 10-over game.
  Act: Run the main function with these parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the play_game function processes 10 overs correctly and that performance remains stable.
Validation:
  This test verifies system performance and accuracy under maximum expected load, ensuring robustness.

Scenario 4: Invalid overs input leading to game exit
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Verifies that the game exits gracefully when an invalid number of overs is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a non-integer value for overs.
  Act: Invoke the main function.
  Assert: Check for the appropriate error message and ensure no further processing (like play_game) occurs.
Validation:
  Ensures the game's resilience to user input errors and robust error handling.

Scenario 5: Difficulty level affects gameplay
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_impact
  Description: Tests whether the difficulty level input correctly influences gameplay mechanics.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for each difficulty level (1, 2, 3).
  Act: Execute the main function separately for each difficulty setting.
  Assert: Verify that the play_game function is called with the appropriate difficulty parameter and that it affects game dynamics as expected.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the difficulty setting is integrated correctly into the game logic, enhancing user experience by providing varied challenge levels.

Scenario 6: Handling of a draw situation
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_game_scenario
  Description: Ensures that the game correctly identifies and handles a draw scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state such that both players end with the same score.
  Act: Run the main function to this predetermined end.
  Assert: Verify that the who_won function correctly announces a draw.
Validation:
  Important for ensuring fairness and correctness in game outcome reporting, fulfilling the game's promise of accurate result declaration.
```

Each scenario is crafted to validate different aspects of the business logic in the `main` function, ensuring comprehensive coverage from user input through to game logic and result declaration.
