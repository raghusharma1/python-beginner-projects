### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Input Flow
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_flow
  Description: Verify that the game flows correctly with valid inputs including a successful toss, valid overs, player choices, and difficulty level selection, resulting in an accurate game result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for `input()` to provide valid overs, player choices during the toss, and difficulty level. Mock `random.randint()` to control the toss outcome.
  Act: Call the `main()` function.
  Assert: Check that the game completes without errors and the correct winner is announced based on the mocked game logic.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game handles typical user interactions correctly and that the main function integrates its sub-components effectively to produce the expected game outcome.

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Number of Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Test the game's response to an invalid overs input (e.g., non-integer or out-of-range values).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `input()` to provide an invalid overs value followed by a valid value to see if error handling redirects correctly.
  Act: Call the `main()` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game prompts again or exits with an appropriate error message without crashing.
Validation:
  Validates the robustness of the input validation for overs, ensuring that the game can handle user errors gracefully.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Difficulty Level
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Check how the game behaves if the user inputs an invalid difficulty level (e.g., non-integer or out-of-range values).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `input()` to provide valid overs and toss choices but an invalid difficulty level, followed by a valid difficulty.
  Act: Call the `main()` function.
  Assert: Ensure the game either reprompts the user or exits with a proper error message.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game's difficulty setting is foolproof against incorrect inputs, maintaining game integrity and user experience.

#### Scenario 4: Toss Winner Scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_winner
  Description: Validate whether the toss determines the first player correctly and that the subsequent choices are set correctly based on the toss outcome.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `input()` for user choices and `random.randint()` to control toss results.
  Act: Call the `main()` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the choices of batting or bowling align with the toss results.
Validation:
  Checks the logical correctness and implementation of the toss and initial game setup, critical for fair play and game progression.

### Testing Guidelines
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Mocking Strategy**: Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to mock user inputs and random values to simulate different game scenarios. This includes handling of the `input()` function and `random.randint()` function.
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure tests cover scenarios where users might input invalid data. Tests should verify that the function handles these gracefully either by reprompting the user or by exiting appropriately.
3. **Integration Testing**: While unit tests might focus on individual functions, ensure that integration tests evaluate how these functions work together in the `main()` function. This includes flow from toss, player choices, game play, to final result announcement.
4. **Output Verification**: Since the function prints results, consider capturing stdout using `pytest`'s capsys or similar features to assert on printed output for correctness.
5. **Boundary Values**: Test boundary conditions such as the minimum and maximum valid number of overs and difficulty levels.
6. **Automated Test Suitability**: Design tests to be part of an automated suite, ensuring they can run without manual input or intervention.
7. **Documentation and Comments**: Each test should be well-documented explaining what aspect of the function it is testing and why, making maintenance easier and future test enhancements more straightforward.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios aim to ensure comprehensive coverage of the `main` function's logic and behavior, emphasizing robustness and user correctness.
