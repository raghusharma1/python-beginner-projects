### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Input Flow
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_flow
  Description: Verify that the game flows correctly when all inputs are valid and within expected ranges.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for number of overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the correct outputs (e.g., final scores and winner announcement) are displayed, and no exceptions are raised.
Validation:
  Testing this scenario ensures that the game handles the ideal path where all inputs are valid. It validates the core functionality of the game based on typical user interactions.

#### Scenario 2: Input Error Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_input_error_handling
  Description: Validate that the game correctly handles invalid input types for overs and difficulty, gracefully exiting without crashing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input to provide invalid string values for overs and difficulty.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that an error message is printed and the game does not proceed to gameplay.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for robust error handling, ensuring the game can manage incorrect inputs without unexpected behavior, adhering to defensive programming principles.

#### Scenario 3: Toss Decision Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_decision_impact
  Description: Ensure that the toss decision correctly influences the game flow, specifically which player bats or bowls first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input to control the outcome of the toss and subsequent player decisions.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game initializes the first move (batting/bowling) based on the toss outcome.
Validation:
  This scenario tests a fundamental aspect of the game logic - the impact of the toss on gameplay. It ensures that the toss outcome is respected throughout the game execution.

#### Scenario 4: Difficulty Level Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_impact
  Description: Check if the difficulty level input correctly influences game mechanics, potentially altering gameplay difficulty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for different difficulty levels.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Observe changes in game behavior or outputs that reflect different difficulty settings.
Validation:
  Validates that the difficulty setting is integrated into the game logic, affecting gameplay as intended. This ensures the game meets diverse player skills and preferences.

#### Scenario 5: Edge Case for Minimum and Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_overs
  Description: Ensure that the game handles the edge cases for minimum (1 over) and maximum (10 overs) input correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for 1 over and 10 overs in separate tests.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the game progresses and concludes correctly for both cases.
Validation:
  Testing edge cases for game duration ensures that the game logic correctly handles both the shortest and longest possible game scenarios.

### Testing Guidelines

BEGIN_GUIDELINE

1. **Mocking User Inputs**: Use `unittest.mock` to simulate user inputs in tests. This allows control over the flow of the game without relying on actual user input.

2. **Error Handling**: Tests should include scenarios for handling unexpected and invalid inputs. Use `pytest.raises` to ensure that errors are handled gracefully.

3. **Output Verification**: Since the function primarily prints outputs, consider using `pytest`'s `capfd` fixture to capture print statements for verification.

4. **Isolation of Functions**: Where possible, isolate tests to specific functionalities (e.g., result of the toss, outcome based on difficulty levels). This simplifies understanding which parts of the code may be failing.

5. **Repeatable and Deterministic Tests**: Ensure tests are deterministic by controlling random elements like the toss. This can be achieved by patching `random.randint` to return a predictable value.

6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include tests for all logical branches and input combinations to ensure comprehensive coverage. This includes testing boundary values for inputs like the number of overs.

7. **Performance Considerations**: While not critical for this application, consider the efficiency of tests and avoid unnecessary complexity that could slow down test execution.

END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios provide a structured approach to testing the `main` function, ensuring both robustness and adherence to specified behaviors.
