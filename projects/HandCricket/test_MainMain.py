### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Input Flow
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_flow
  Description: Verify that the game flows correctly with valid inputs including a valid number of overs, valid decisions after toss, and valid difficulty level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Run the main function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the correct outputs are printed and the final scores are returned as expected.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles the expected valid inputs correctly and progresses as intended, which is crucial for a positive user experience.

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Number of Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Test the main function's response to an invalid overs input (e.g., a non-integer or an out-of-range integer).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for overs as a string or an invalid number and valid inputs for other prompts.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Verify that the game prints an "Invalid input, exiting game" message and terminates without crashing.
Validation:
  Validates the robustness of the game in handling user input errors on the number of overs, ensuring the game does not proceed with invalid data.

#### Scenario 3: Toss Winner Decision
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_winner_decision
  Description: Ensure that the toss decision correctly influences the game flow, particularly which player bats or bowls first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the toss result and subsequent player choices.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check that the game initializes with the correct player batting first based on the toss.
Validation:
  This test checks the integrity of the game logic following the toss, a fundamental aspect of the game setup.

#### Scenario 4: Difficulty Level Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_impact
  Description: Verify that the selected difficulty level is passed correctly to the play_game function and influences the game mechanics as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock all inputs, including a specific difficulty level.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Confirm that the difficulty level affects game dynamics, such as scoring probabilities (not directly observable without additional function details).
Validation:
  Ensures that the difficulty setting is functional and affects the game appropriately, which is crucial for user satisfaction and game replayability.

#### Scenario 5: Input Handling During Player Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_player_choice_handling
  Description: Ensure that the game correctly handles and reflects player choices in terms of batting and bowling order after the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the toss result and capture player inputs for batting or bowling.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Verify that the game progresses with the players in the correct roles (batting/bowling) as chosen.
Validation:
  This test is essential for confirming that player decisions are respected and correctly influence the game, which is central to gameplay integrity.

### Comprehensive Audit Guidelines for Test Cases of the Provided Python main Function
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
- Ensure all test cases use mocking to simulate user inputs and random outcomes to achieve consistent test results.
- Utilize a testing framework capable of capturing printed outputs for validation against expected results.
- Implement error handling in test cases to gracefully manage both expected and unexpected inputs by checking for exceptions or specific output messages.
- Structure tests to cover both the normal and edge cases to comprehensively evaluate all possible game scenarios.
- Maintain clear and concise documentation for each test scenario to facilitate understanding and maintenance.
