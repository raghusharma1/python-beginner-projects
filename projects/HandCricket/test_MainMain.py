```
Scenario 1: Valid number of overs and difficulty level with toss winning by Player 1 who chooses to bat first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player1_bats_first
  Description: This test verifies that the game flow proceeds correctly when valid inputs are provided, and Player 1 wins the toss and opts to bat first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for number of overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level. Assume all inputs are within valid ranges.
  Act: Run the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the correct outputs (score and winner) are displayed and that no exceptions are raised.
Validation:
  This test validates the correct game flow and output given valid user inputs and ensures that the game handles the scenario of Player 1 batting first correctly.

Scenario 2: Valid input with Player 2 winning the toss and choosing to bowl first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player2_bowls_first
  Description: This test checks if the game correctly handles the scenario where Player 2 wins the toss and decides to bowl first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for number of overs, toss result, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Execute the main function with these mocked inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the game flow is correct, including the correct alternation of batting and bowling, and that the final scores and winner are correctly computed and displayed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that player choices after the toss are respected and correctly influence game flow, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game rules.

Scenario 3: Handling of invalid over input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Ensures that the game gracefully handles a scenario where the input for overs is outside the valid range (1-10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide an invalid number of overs (e.g., 11 or 0).
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check that the game outputs an error message and exits without crashing.
Validation:
  This test is important for ensuring robustness and user error handling in the game setup phase.

Scenario 4: Handling of invalid difficulty level input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Verifies that the game correctly handles cases where the difficulty level input is invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock valid inputs for overs and toss, but provide an invalid difficulty level (e.g., 4).
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: Assert that an error message is displayed and the game does not proceed with an invalid state.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game maintains integrity by not proceeding with invalid configurations, which is crucial for fair play and user experience.

Scenario 5: Draw situation handling
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_game_scenario
  Description: Tests whether the game correctly identifies and handles a draw situation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the play_game function to return equal scores for both players.
  Act: Invoke the main function with this setup.
  Assert: Verify that the "The match ended in a draw" message is correctly displayed.
Validation:
  Testing draw scenarios is essential to ensure that all possible game outcomes are handled gracefully and correctly according to the rules.
