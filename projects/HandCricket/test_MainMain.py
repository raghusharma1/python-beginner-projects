### Test Scenarios for the `main` Function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Input Flow
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_flow
  Description: Verify that the game flows correctly with valid inputs including a valid number of overs, valid decisions after toss, and a valid difficulty level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for overs, toss decisions, and difficulty level.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check that the correct outputs are printed and the `who_won` function is called with the correct scores.
Validation:
  This test ensures that with valid inputs, the game progresses as expected and concludes with the correct winner or a draw, adhering to the game rules and logic.

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Number of Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Test the function's response to invalid input for the number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for overs with a non-integer value.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Verify that an error message is printed and the game does not proceed.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's robustness in handling non-integer inputs for overs, ensuring that the game does not proceed with invalid configurations.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Difficulty Level
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Ensure the game handles non-integer input for the difficulty level correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock valid inputs for overs and toss decisions, but an invalid input for difficulty level.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check that an error message is printed and the game terminates appropriately.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the game's setup phase is protected against incorrect difficulty inputs, preserving game integrity.

#### Scenario 4: Edge Case for Minimum and Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_overs
  Description: Assess the game's behavior at the boundary values of the overs input (1 and 10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for the minimum and maximum valid overs.
  Act: Execute the main function twice, once with each boundary value.
  Assert: Ensure the game completes without errors and the correct processes are followed.
Validation:
  Testing boundary values for overs ensures that the game logic correctly handles the smallest and largest possible valid games, maintaining consistent gameplay across supported configurations.

#### Scenario 5: Toss Decision Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_decision_impact
  Description: Verify that the game correctly assigns batting and bowling based on toss outcomes and player choices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs where each player wins the toss and makes a decision.
  Act: Run the main function for each scenario.
  Assert: Check that player roles (batting/bowling) are assigned according to the toss and subsequent decisions.
Validation:
  This test checks that the initial game setup correctly respects the toss outcome and player decisions, which is critical for correct gameplay according to the rules.

### Comprehensive Audit Guidelines for Test Cases of the Provided Python main Function

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Input Mocking**: Ensure that all user inputs are fully mocked in the test environment. This includes inputs for overs, player decisions post-toss, and difficulty levels. Use libraries like `unittest.mock` to simulate `input()` and `random.randint()` calls.

2. **Function Call Verification**: Use mocking to verify that key functions (`toss`, `play_game`, `who_won`) are called with the correct parameters. This is crucial to ensure that the game logic integrates correctly.

3. **Output Verification**: Since the function primarily prints outputs, capture these outputs using `unittest.mock` patching on `sys.stdout`. Verify that the expected messages are printed in various scenarios.

4. **Error Handling**: Test cases must specifically check for proper error messages and system responses when invalid inputs are provided. This ensures that the game does not proceed under invalid configurations.

5. **Boundary Conditions**: Include tests for the boundary values of all inputs (e.g., minimum and maximum overs). This ensures stability and reliability across the supported input range.

6. **Game Logic Integrity**: Verify that game logic (like player roles and scoring) follows the intended design by checking the state of the game at key points, if possible.

7. **Cleanup and Isolation**: Each test should be self-contained and clean up any changes it makes to the environment. This ensures that tests do not interfere with each other and can run in any order.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios ensure a thorough testing approach that validates both the functional and error-handling aspects of the `main` function, adhering closely to the provided specifications and business logic.
