Here are several test scenarios for the `main` function in the provided Python code:

### Scenario 1: Successful Game Flow with Minimum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_game_flow_min_overs
  Description: This test verifies that the game can be played successfully with the minimum overs input (1 over).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` for number of overs, toss decision, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the correct functions are called and outputs are printed as expected.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game initializes correctly with the minimum boundary for overs, and progresses through all steps without errors, adhering to the game's designed flow and rules.

### Scenario 2: Successful Game Flow with Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_game_flow_max_overs
  Description: This test ensures that the game handles the maximum overs input (10 overs) correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` for number of overs, toss decision, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game progresses through the complete sequence of overs without any errors.
Validation:
  Validates that the game can handle the upper limit of overs input, which is critical for ensuring robustness in gameplay duration handling.

### Scenario 3: Invalid Overs Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Tests the game's response to an invalid overs input (e.g., a non-integer or out-of-range integer).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to provide an invalid overs value.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check for the appropriate error message and exit of the game.
Validation:
  Ensures the game's resilience against invalid user inputs for overs, protecting against crashes and unintended behavior.

### Scenario 4: Invalid Difficulty Level Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: This test checks the game's handling of invalid difficulty level inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to provide a non-integer or out-of-range difficulty level after valid inputs for other prompts.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game outputs an error message and exits appropriately.
Validation:
  Critical for maintaining game integrity and user experience, ensuring that only valid difficulty settings are accepted.

### Scenario 5: Player 1 Wins Toss and Chooses to Bat First
Details:
  TestName: test_player1_wins_toss_chooses_bat
  Description: Verifies that when Player 1 wins the toss and chooses to bat first, the game flow adjusts accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to simulate Player 1 winning the toss and choosing to bat.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that Player 2 is set to bowl first and the game proceeds with these roles.
Validation:
  Ensures correct implementation of the toss and choice mechanics, which are pivotal for setting up the game's initial conditions.

### Scenario 6: Handle Game Draw
Details:
  TestName: test_game_draw_scenario
  Description: Ensures that a draw is correctly identified and reported when both players end with the same score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game state such that both players finish with equal scores.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game identifies the draw and prints the appropriate message.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's ability to conclude correctly in the case of a draw, an essential part of game result determination.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the game handles a variety of input conditions and game states correctly, providing a robust test suite for the main gameplay function.
