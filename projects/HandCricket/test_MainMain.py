```python
Scenario 1: Validate the game with valid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_game
  Description: This test is intended to verify the expected behavior of the game when valid inputs are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with valid inputs for overs, player1_choice, player2_choice, and difficulty.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the initialized inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the correct calculation and display of scores, and the correct winner based on the scores.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles valid inputs correctly and displays the correct game results. It verifies the correct execution of the main business logic of the function.

Scenario 2: Verify game behavior with minimal and maximal overs
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_overs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's response to minimal (1) and maximal (10) overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with overs as 1 and 10, and other inputs as valid.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the initialized inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the correct calculation and display of scores for the respective overs, and the correct winner based on the scores.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles the boundary values of overs correctly. It verifies the function's robustness in handling edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test the game's behavior with invalid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the function's behavior when invalid inputs are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with invalid inputs for overs, player1_choice, player2_choice, or difficulty.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the initialized inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the function's correct handling of invalid inputs, which is to print "Invalid input, exiting game" and exit the game.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles invalid inputs correctly and exits the game gracefully. It verifies the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Test the game's performance with maximum overs and difficulty
Details:
  TestName: test_performance_maximum_overs_difficulty
  Description: This test is intended to assess the function's efficiency when the game is played with maximum overs and difficulty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with overs as 10 and difficulty as 3, and other inputs as valid.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the initialized inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the correct and efficient calculation and display of scores, and the correct winner based on the scores, within acceptable time limits.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function performs efficiently even under stress. It verifies the function's performance capabilities.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Correctness: Ensure that the function returns expected results for valid inputs by comparing the returned scores and winner with the expected scores and winner.
Boundary Conditions: Test the function’s response to minimal and maximal overs by providing overs as 1 and 10 respectively and verifying the correct calculation and display of scores.
Error Handling: Verify the function’s behavior with invalid inputs by providing such inputs and checking if the function correctly prints "Invalid input, exiting game" and exits the game.
Performance: Assess the function's efficiency with maximum overs and difficulty by measuring the time it takes for the function to calculate and display the scores and determine the winner.
Security: While security may not be a major concern for this function, ensure that any input manipulations do not breach data integrity or security by providing such manipulations and checking if the function handles them correctly.
