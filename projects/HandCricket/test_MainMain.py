```
Scenario 1: Valid number of overs and valid difficulty level input
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_overs_and_difficulty
  Description: Checks if the game proceeds correctly with valid overs and difficulty inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for the number of overs (e.g., 5 overs) and difficulty level (e.g., Easy). Also mock the toss and player choices.
  Act: Run the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Verify that no ValueError is raised and the game completes successfully.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle valid numeric inputs and progresses as expected. Correct handling of valid inputs is crucial for a smooth user experience.

Scenario 2: Invalid number of overs input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Ensures that the game handles non-numeric or out-of-range overs input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for the number of overs with an invalid value (e.g., "eleven" or 20).
  Act: Run the main function with the mocked input.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised, and the game does not proceed.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the game against invalid overs input, ensuring that the error handling for user inputs is functioning as designed.

Scenario 3: Invalid difficulty level input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Verifies that entering a non-numeric or out-of-range difficulty level results in appropriate error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock valid overs input and invalid difficulty level input (e.g., "hard" instead of 3).
  Act: Run the main function with these inputs.
  Assert: Confirm that a ValueError is raised, and the game does not proceed.
Validation:
  This test validates that the game correctly handles errors related to difficulty level input, which is essential for maintaining game integrity and user feedback.

Scenario 4: Proper handling of toss and player choices
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_and_player_choices
  Description: Tests whether the toss result correctly influences the choices available to the players and their subsequent game roles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the toss function to control the outcome and the subsequent player choices.
  Act: Run the main function with controlled toss results and check if players' choices correspond correctly.
  Assert: Verify that player choices after the toss align with the mocked toss outcome.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game logic correctly interprets the toss results in setting the roles of players, which is crucial for game progression and fairness.

Scenario 5: Complete game simulation with random inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_complete_game_simulation
  Description: Simulates a complete game with random valid inputs to ensure all parts of the game work together without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use random but valid inputs for overs, difficulty, and mock random outcomes for toss and player choices.
  Act: Execute the main function with these inputs and simulate user turns.
  Assert: Check that the game completes without errors and outputs the correct winner or a draw.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the integration of all game components, ensuring that when put together, they function as expected and handle varied inputs smoothly.
