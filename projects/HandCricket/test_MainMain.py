```
Scenario 1: Valid input flow with Player 1 winning the toss and choosing to bat first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player1_bats_first
  Description: This test verifies that the flow of the game proceeds correctly when player 1 wins the toss and opts to bat first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for number of overs, toss outcome, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Check if the correct messages are displayed and the correct functions are called with expected parameters.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game logic correctly handles a common scenario where player 1 wins the toss and chooses to bat, which is a fundamental aspect of the game's functionality.

Scenario 2: Valid input flow with Player 2 winning the toss and choosing to bowl first
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player2_bowls_first
  Description: This test verifies that the game handles the scenario where player 2 wins the toss and chooses to bowl first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for the number of overs, toss outcome, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function.
  Assert: Validate that the game progresses as expected with correct function invocations and parameters.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the game's ability to correctly adapt the order of play based on the toss and player decisions, crucial for gameplay integrity.

Scenario 3: Invalid number of overs input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Tests the game's response to an invalid input for the number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an input for overs that is outside the valid range (e.g., 11 or -1).
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: Verify that an error message is displayed and the game does not proceed.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game correctly handles out-of-range inputs for overs, maintaining game rules and preventing crashes or undefined behavior.

Scenario 4: Invalid difficulty level input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Checks how the game behaves when given an invalid difficulty level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a difficulty level that is not among the predefined options (e.g., 4 or 0).
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Confirm that an error message is shown and the game terminates appropriately.
Validation:
  Validates the game's robustness in handling incorrect difficulty settings, which is vital for ensuring a fair and enjoyable game experience.

Scenario 5: Handle non-integer inputs for overs and difficulty
Details:
  TestName: test_non_integer_inputs
  Description: This test assesses the game's error handling when non-integer values are input for overs and difficulty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input strings or floating-point numbers for overs and difficulty settings.
  Act: Call the main function.
  Assert: Ensure the game identifies the inputs as invalid and exits without proceeding.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the game maintains integrity and user experience by preventing non-integer inputs where integers are expected.

Scenario 6: Simulate a tie game scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_tie_game_scenario
  Description: Verifies the game's logic and output when both players end with the same score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the play_game function to return equal scores for both players.
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: Check that the game correctly identifies and announces a tie.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game can correctly conclude and communicate a tie, an essential part of game result handling.

Scenario 7: Test game flow with minimum and maximum valid overs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_overs_input
  Description: Tests the game's behavior at the boundary values of the overs input (1 and 10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Input overs as 1 and then 10 in separate tests, with valid inputs for other parameters.
  Act: Run the main function for each case.
  Assert: Verify that the game completes without errors and with expected results.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the game handles edge cases for the number of overs, adhering to game specifications and ensuring a broad range of gameplay experiences.
```
These scenarios cover both normal operational flows and exceptional or edge cases, ensuring comprehensive testing of the `main` function's business logic and its interaction with other parts of the system.
