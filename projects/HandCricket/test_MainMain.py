Scenario 1: Validate the game with correct inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_correct_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct flow of the game with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for the number of overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check if the game runs without any exceptions and the score is displayed at the end.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the game's basic functionality and validate the implemented logic.

Scenario 2: Check behavior with minimum input values
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_min_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the game's behavior with the minimum allowed input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for the number of overs (1), toss, player choices, and difficulty level (1).
  Act: Invoke the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check if the game runs without any exceptions and the score is displayed at the end.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle its boundary conditions properly, specifically the minimum input values.

Scenario 3: Check behavior with maximum input values
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_max_values
  Description: This test is intended to verify the game's behavior with the maximum allowed input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for the number of overs (10), toss, player choices, and difficulty level (3).
  Act: Invoke the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check if the game runs without any exceptions and the score is displayed at the end.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle its boundary conditions properly, specifically the maximum input values.

Scenario 4: Verify the game's response to invalid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_invalid_inputs
  Description: This test verifies that the game handles invalid inputs correctly by raising a ValueError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs with invalid values.
  Act: Invoke the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check if a ValueError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is necessary to ensure that the game can handle erroneous situations gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Correctness: The test scenarios should ensure that the game functions correctly with all valid inputs, correctly assigning the toss winner, player choices, and calculating the score.
Boundary Conditions: The game should handle minimum and maximum input values correctly without causing any exceptions or errors.
Error Handling: The game should correctly handle invalid inputs by raising a ValueError.
Performance: While not explicitly covered in the above scenarios, additional tests could be created to ensure the game performs well with a large number of overs.
Security: As the game does not involve any sensitive data or operations, security is not a major concern for these test scenarios.
