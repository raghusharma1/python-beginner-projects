### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Inputs and Player 1 Wins
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player1_wins
  Description: Test the game flow with valid inputs where Player 1 wins the game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function identifies Player 1 as the winner based on the mocked game scores.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game correctly processes valid inputs and correctly identifies the winner, adhering to the game's logic and rules.

#### Scenario 2: Valid Inputs and Draw Game
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_draw_game
  Description: Test the game flow with valid inputs resulting in a draw.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level where both players end up with the same score.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function identifies the game as a draw.
Validation:
  This test checks the game's ability to correctly identify a draw, which is crucial for ensuring game fairness and proper result announcement.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Number of Overs Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Test the game's response to an invalid number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for an invalid number of overs (e.g., a negative number or a non-integer).
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Expect the game to handle the error and exit without crashing.
Validation:
  Ensures robust error handling and user input validation, which is essential for maintaining game integrity and user experience.

#### Scenario 4: Invalid Difficulty Level Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_difficulty_input
  Description: Test how the game handles an invalid difficulty level input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock valid inputs for overs and toss, but provide an invalid difficulty level (e.g., a number outside the expected range).
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Expect the game to handle the input error and exit gracefully.
Validation:
  Validates that the game correctly handles invalid inputs for game settings, ensuring that users are prompted correctly and game integrity is maintained.

#### Scenario 5: Edge Case with Minimum and Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_min_max_overs
  Description: Test the game with the minimum (1 over) and maximum (10 overs) limits.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs to test the game at both boundary conditions.
  Act: Run the `main` function twice, once with 1 over and once with 10 overs.
  Assert: Verify that the game handles both scenarios correctly without errors.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game logic correctly handles boundary conditions for game length, which is critical for gameplay flexibility and user engagement.

### BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Testing Guidelines for `main` function:**

1. **Correctness**: Ensure that all game outcomes (win, loss, draw) are correctly determined based on the scores computed during gameplay. This involves mocking the `play_game` function to return predetermined scores.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: Test with the minimum and maximum valid inputs for overs and difficulty levels. Ensure that the game does not accept values outside of these limits and handles edge cases gracefully.

3. **Error Handling**: Inputs through `input()` should be mocked to test the game's response to non-integer and out-of-bound values. The game should handle such errors without crashing, providing clear messages to the user.

4. **Performance**: While performance might not be critical for a simple console game, it's useful to ensure that the game runs efficiently even at the upper limits of input sizes (e.g., maximum overs).

5. **Security**: Since the game involves random elements (toss), ensure that the randomness does not introduce any bias or predictability in the game outcomes. Mocking and testing these elements can help verify the integrity of game logic.

END_GUIDELINE

These scenarios and guidelines will help ensure that `main` function not only meets its functional requirements but also handles user interactions and game rules effectively and robustly.
