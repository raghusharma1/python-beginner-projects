### Scenario 1: Valid Input Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_handling
  Description: This test checks if the main function handles valid input correctly, including valid overs, toss choices, batting/bowling choices, and difficulty levels.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to provide valid inputs sequentially for overs, toss choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game progresses without any exceptions and that the correct messages indicating the progress of the game are printed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle expected valid inputs without errors, which is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience and game flow.

### Scenario 2: Invalid Over Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_over_input
  Description: This test verifies that the main function correctly handles a non-integer or out-of-range input for overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for the number of overs to be a non-integer or an invalid integer.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the function prints an "Invalid input, exiting game" message.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the game can gracefully handle incorrect input for overs is essential to prevent crashes and inform the user about the mistake, improving the user experience.

### Scenario 3: Toss Decision Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_decision_impact
  Description: This test checks whether the toss decision correctly influences subsequent choices for batting or bowling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate a specific toss winner and their subsequent choice.
  Act: Call the `main` function while controlling the inputs for the toss and subsequent choices.
  Assert: Verify that the player choices are set correctly based on the toss result.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial for ensuring that the logic deciding who bats or bowls first based on the toss result is implemented correctly, directly impacting game fairness and adherence to game rules.

### Scenario 4: Difficulty Level Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_impact
  Description: Examine if the difficulty level input correctly influences the gameplay mechanics in the `play_game` function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check if the difficulty parameter is correctly passed to `play_game` and affects the game mechanics as expected.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the difficulty settings are functional and influence the game's challenge level, which is vital for user engagement and game versatility.

### Scenario 5: Game Outcome Announcement
Details:
  TestName: test_game_outcome_announcement
  Description: This test ensures that the game correctly announces the winner based on the scores obtained from the gameplay.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `play_game` to return predetermined scores.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the `who_won` function is called with the correct scores and that the function outputs the correct winner.
Validation:
  Validating the correct announcement of the game's outcome is essential for providing closure to the players and confirming the integrity of the scoring mechanism.
