Scenario 1: Validate the game with correct inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_correct_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the correct flow of the game with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the inputs for the number of overs, player's choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function with pre-set inputs, bypassing the input function.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the correct flow of the game and the display of the winner at the end.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the game works as expected with valid inputs and the game logic is correctly implemented.

Scenario 2: Validate the game with invalid inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_game_with_invalid_inputs
  Description: This test is intended to verify the game's response to invalid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize invalid inputs for the number of overs, player's choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function with these inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the game exiting with an error message.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle invalid inputs gracefully and exit without breaking.

Scenario 3: Test the boundary conditions
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_conditions
  Description: This test is intended to check the game's response to minimal and maximal input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize inputs with boundary values for the number of overs and difficulty level.
  Act: Invoke the main function with these inputs.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the correct flow of the game and the display of the winner at the end.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle boundary inputs correctly and the game logic works as expected.

Scenario 4: Test the game performance
Details:
  TestName: test_game_performance
  Description: This test is intended to assess the game's performance with a large number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a large value for the number of overs.
  Act: Invoke the main function with this input.
  Assert: The expected outcome is that the game should run smoothly without any performance issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can handle large inputs without any performance degradation.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
For testing this game, the following guidelines should be followed:

1. Correctness: The test should ensure that the game works correctly with valid inputs. The game logic should be correctly implemented and the winner should be correctly displayed at the end.

2. Boundary Conditions: The test should check the game's response to minimal and maximal input values. The game should be able to handle these inputs correctly.

3. Error Handling: The test should verify the game's response to invalid inputs. The game should exit gracefully with an error message.

4. Performance: The test should assess the game's performance with a large number of overs. The game should run smoothly without any performance degradation.

5. Security: The test should check that no input manipulations can breach data integrity or security. This could be tested by trying to manipulate the score or the number of wickets.
