### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Inputs and Player 1 Wins
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_player1_wins
  Description: This test verifies that the game processes valid inputs correctly and determines the correct winner when Player 1 scores higher than Player 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for number of overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty.
  Act: Run the `main` function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check if the output indicates that Player 1 is the winner.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the function should correctly handle valid game settings and player inputs, computing scores accurately and declaring the correct winner.

#### Scenario 2: Valid Inputs and Match Draw
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_match_draw
  Description: This test ensures that the game identifies a draw correctly when both players end up with the same score.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs such that the final scores of both players are equal.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game output declares a draw.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the game logic appropriately handles and reports a draw scenario, adhering to cricket match rules.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Input for Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: Tests the game's response to non-integer input for the number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string input instead of an integer for overs.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Check for the "Invalid input, exiting game" message.
Validation:
  It's vital to ensure the game gracefully handles erroneous data types for overs input, preventing crashes or undefined behaviors.

#### Scenario 4: Edge Case for Minimum and Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_overs
  Description: Verifies that the game functions correctly at the boundary values of the overs input (1 and 10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Test the function twice, once with 1 over and once with 10 overs.
  Act: Execute the `main` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Confirm that the game processes these inputs without errors and produces a result.
Validation:
  Boundary testing ensures the game handles the smallest and largest valid values for overs, crucial for game integrity and user experience.

#### Scenario 5: Handling of Incorrect Difficulty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_difficulty_input
  Description: Ensures the game exits gracefully when provided a non-integer or out-of-range difficulty level.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string or an out-of-bound integer for difficulty.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game outputs an error message and exits.
Validation:
  It's essential to validate that the game manages invalid difficulty inputs correctly, enhancing robustness and ensuring a consistent user experience.

#### Scenario 6: Performance Under Maximum Stress
Details:
  TestName: test_performance_under_stress
  Description: Tests the game's performance by setting the maximum allowed overs and simulating rapid, consecutive game sessions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a loop to run the game several times with the maximum overs.
  Act: Execute these game sessions in quick succession.
  Assert: Check that the game completes all sessions without performance degradation or errors.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the game performs well under stress conditions is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience during peak usage.

### BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**: Each test should ensure that the game logic adheres strictly to the rules of cricket, correctly computes scores, and identifies the winner or a draw accurately.

**Boundary Conditions**: Tests must include input at the edges of valid ranges (e.g., minimum and maximum overs). This ensures that the game handles such cases gracefully without errors or unexpected behavior.

**Error Handling**: The scenarios should include tests for handling invalid input types and values, checking if the game exits or responds with user-friendly error messages.

**Performance**: Consider scenarios that test the game's response under heavy load or maximum input values, ensuring it remains responsive and stable.

**Security**: While not directly applicable in a simple game scenario, it's good practice to ensure that input handling does not allow for injection of unintended commands or data manipulation.
