### Scenario 1: Valid Input for Minimum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_minimum_overs
  Description: Verify that the game can handle the minimum overs input correctly and completes without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for minimum overs (1 over), a valid toss outcome, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main()` function with these mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the game completes without errors and returns the correct scoring based on the gameplay logic.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the system can handle the lower boundary of the overs input. Correct handling of minimum input values is crucial for system stability and user satisfaction.

### Scenario 2: Valid Input for Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_input_maximum_overs
  Description: Verify that the game can handle the maximum overs input correctly and completes without issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for maximum overs (10 overs), a valid toss outcome, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main()` function with these mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the game completes without errors and returns the correct scoring based on the gameplay logic.
Validation:
  This test checks the system's ability to handle the upper boundary of the overs input, ensuring the game logic performs well even at maximum input limits.

### Scenario 3: Handle Input Error on Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_input_error_on_overs
  Description: Test how the game behaves when an invalid input (non-integer) is entered for overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a non-integer value when overs are requested.
  Act: Call the `main()` function.
  Assert: Verify that the game handles the error gracefully, printing an error message without crashing.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure the game can handle user input errors gracefully, improving the robustness of the application.

### Scenario 4: Correct Player Choices After Toss
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_player_choices_after_toss
  Description: Ensure that player choices for batting or bowling are correctly set based on the toss outcome.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the toss outcome and subsequent player choices.
  Act: Run the `main()` function with these mocked inputs.
  Assert: Verify that player choices are correctly set opposite to each other based on the toss outcome.
Validation:
  This test validates the business logic that the player who loses the toss gets the opposite choice of the winner, which is fundamental to the game's rules.

### Scenario 5: Game Results Match Player Scores
Details:
  TestName: test_game_results_match_player_scores
  Description: Confirm that the game results announced by `who_won` match the actual scores returned from `play_game`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for a controlled game scenario where scores can be predicted.
  Act: Run the `main()` function and capture the output.
  Assert: Ensure the output from `who_won` corresponds accurately to the scores generated in `play_game`.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the game's outcome is accurately reported based on the scores is crucial for maintaining the integrity and fairness of the game.

### Scenario 6: Difficulty Level Impact
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_impact
  Description: Verify that different difficulty levels affect the game mechanics as expected, possibly altering player scores.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for each difficulty level under controlled conditions.
  Act: Run the `main()` function separately for each difficulty level.
  Assert: Compare the scores to check if higher difficulty levels result in lower scores or increased game complexity.
Validation:
  This test assesses whether the difficulty setting impacts the game dynamics, an important feature for catering to a range of player skills.
