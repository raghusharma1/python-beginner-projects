### Scenario 1: Valid Input for Minimum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_minimum_overs
  Description: This test verifies that the game can be played with the minimum overs limit (1 over).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for overs, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function with mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the function completes without errors and returns a valid score.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the game handles the smallest valid number of overs correctly, which is crucial for the flexibility and robustness of the game logic.

### Scenario 2: Valid Input for Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_maximum_overs
  Description: This test checks that the game can handle the maximum overs limit (10 overs).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for overs, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function with mocked inputs.
  Assert: Verify that the function completes without errors and that scores are computed.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game correctly handles the upper boundary for the number of overs, which is essential for ensuring that the game's limits are respected.

### Scenario 3: Toss Winner Chooses to Bat
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_winner_chooses_bat
  Description: Test to verify that if the toss winner chooses to bat first, the choices are correctly reflected in the game logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the toss result to a specific winner and mock the choice of batting first.
  Act: Call the `main` function with the mocked setup.
  Assert: Verify that the correct player bats first based on the toss result and choice.
Validation:
  This test validates the correctness of the toss and choice implementation, ensuring that the game follows the correct sequence of play based on user decisions.

### Scenario 4: Input of Invalid Number of Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: This test checks the game's handling of invalid overs input (e.g., 0 or 11).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for an invalid number of overs.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check for the appropriate error handling or message indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Validates the game's robustness in dealing with user input errors, ensuring that only valid configurations lead to game play.

### Scenario 5: Difficulty Level Boundary Test
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_boundaries
  Description: Verify that the game handles the lowest and highest difficulty levels correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to test both the lowest (1) and highest (3) difficulty levels.
  Act: Call the `main` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Ensure that the game logic behaves as expected without errors.
Validation:
  This test checks the functionality of difficulty level settings, ensuring that the game adjusts its complexity according to the user's choice.

### Scenario 6: Handling Non-integer Input for Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_non_integer_overs_input
  Description: Ensures that entering a non-integer value for overs results in appropriate error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input to provide a non-integer value for overs.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that an error message is displayed and the game does not proceed.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle incorrect data types for critical inputs, essential for maintaining game integrity.

### Scenario 7: Simulated Full Game Play
Details:
  TestName: test_full_game_simulation
  Description: Simulate a full game from start to finish, including all user interactions and game outcomes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock all user inputs for a complete game setup and play.
  Act: Call the `main` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the game completes, scores are calculated, and a winner is declared correctly.
Validation:
  This comprehensive test ensures that all components of the game work together seamlessly to provide a complete and correct gameplay experience.
