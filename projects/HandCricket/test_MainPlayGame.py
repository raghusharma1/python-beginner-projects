### Scenario 1: Basic Gameplay Flow with Minimum Overs and Player Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_gameplay_flow
  Description: Verify that the game correctly handles the minimum number of overs (1 over) and basic player choices (player 1 bats first, player 2 bowls).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game with 1 over, player1_choice as '1' (batting), and player2_choice as '2' (bowling).
  Act: Call the play_game function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple containing the scores of player 1 and player 2, and both scores should be integers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game can run with the minimum setup and validates the scoring mechanism in a controlled scenario. It checks if the game adheres to the basic rules and flow, such as batting and bowling turns.

### Scenario 2: Multiple Overs Gameplay Consistency
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_overs_gameplay_consistency
  Description: This test checks if the game maintains consistent behavior over multiple overs (e.g., 5 overs) with players alternating roles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game with 5 overs, alternating player choices each over.
  Act: Call the play_game function for 5 overs with alternating choices.
  Assert: Verify that the scores and wickets are correctly calculated and returned after 5 overs.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the game logic holds across multiple overs and player role switches. It helps confirm the robustness of the game's scoring and wicket deduction mechanics over a longer game.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case with Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_maximum_overs_edge_case
  Description: Test the game's behavior when played with a large number of overs (e.g., 50 overs), which is typical for a full cricket match.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with 50 overs, with consistent player choices.
  Act: Run the play_game function with the set number of overs.
  Assert: Ensure that the game completes without errors and the final scores are in a plausible range given the number of overs.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's scalability and performance under potentially stressful conditions. It ensures the game logic does not break down with a high number of overs.

### Scenario 4: Gameplay with All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_all_wickets_lost_gameplay
  Description: Validate the game's behavior when all wickets are lost before the set overs are completed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a game where players are likely to lose all wickets quickly (e.g., high difficulty settings if applicable).
  Act: Execute the play_game function under these conditions.
  Assert: Check that the game ends or continues correctly after all wickets are lost, and scores are reported accurately.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game handles the scenario of all wickets being lost correctly, an essential part of cricket game rules.

### Scenario 5: Validating Scoreboard Display Accuracy
Details:
  TestName: test_scoreboard_display_accuracy
  Description: Ensure that the scoreboard displays accurate scores after each over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a controlled game scenario with known outcomes for each over.
  Act: Simulate the game and capture the output of the scoreboard display.
  Assert: Validate that the displayed scores match the expected outcomes for each over.
Validation:
  This test confirms the accuracy and reliability of the scoreboard display, which is crucial for providing real-time game progress to players. Ensuring that players receive correct feedback is fundamental to the game's usability and integrity.
