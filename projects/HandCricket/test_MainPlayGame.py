### Scenario 1: Basic Play Game Functionality with Equal Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_basic_equal_choices
  Description: Test the play_game function with both players choosing the same option (batting or bowling) to ensure the game processes turns correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the parameters for a game where both players choose to bat.
  Act: Call the play_game function with both players choosing to bat.
  Assert: Confirm that the game completes without errors and returns a score for both players.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the test confirms that the game logic can handle the scenario where both players choose the same action throughout the game. This test ensures that turns are alternated correctly between players.

### Scenario 2: Play Game with No Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_zero_overs
  Description: Verify that the play_game function handles a game setup with zero overs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game parameters with zero overs.
  Act: Call the play_game function with the overs parameter set to zero.
  Assert: Check that both player scores are zero and no turns are played.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game logic correctly interprets zero as the number of overs and avoids unnecessary gameplay, aligning with typical cricket rules where zero overs mean no play.

### Scenario 3: Play Game with Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_max_overs
  Description: Validate that the play_game function can handle a high number of overs without errors and manages the lengthy game correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game with a very high number of overs, e.g., 50.
  Act: Execute the play_game function with this high overs setting.
  Assert: Ensure that the game completes and returns reasonable scores based on the number of overs.
Validation:
  This test checks the scalability and performance of the game logic under a high-load scenario, ensuring it can manage extensive game sessions.

### Scenario 4: Play Game with Alternating Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_alternating_choices
  Description: Test the game's response to players alternating their choices between batting and bowling each over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game where player choices alternate each over.
  Act: Simulate the game with alternating choices.
  Assert: Verify that the game correctly processes the alternating strategy and updates scores and wickets appropriately.
Validation:
  Validates the game's ability to handle dynamic strategies, ensuring flexibility and correctness in scorekeeping and turn management.

### Scenario 5: Play Game with All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_all_wickets_lost
  Description: Ensure that the game correctly ends or stops allowing a player to bat when all wickets are lost.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a scenario where one player quickly loses all wickets.
  Act: Play the game under these conditions.
  Assert: Confirm that no further batting occurs for the player who lost all wickets and the game concludes correctly.
Validation:
  This test checks the game's adherence to cricket rules regarding wicket loss, ensuring the game ends appropriately for players who can no longer bat.

### Scenario 6: Play Game Under Different Difficulties
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_difficulty_variation
  Description: Examine how varying difficulty settings affect gameplay, focusing on any changes in game dynamics or score calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Run multiple games with different difficulty settings.
  Act: Compare the outcomes and gameplay dynamics under each setting.
  Assert: Assess whether the difficulty impacts game results as expected.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's ability to modify its behavior based on difficulty, a crucial feature for catering to different player skills and ensuring game balance.
