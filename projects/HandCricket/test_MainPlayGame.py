### Scenario 1: Basic Gameplay Flow with Zero Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_zero_overs
  Description: This test verifies that the game handles a scenario where no overs are to be played, ensuring that scores remain at zero and no gameplay actions are performed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number of overs to 0.
  Act: Call the play_game function with the overs parameter set to 0.
  Assert: Check that both player scores are 0.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly implements the game's rules when no overs are set, which is crucial for ensuring the game's flexibility and correctness under minimal input conditions.

### Scenario 2: Gameplay with Alternating Player Roles
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_alternating_roles
  Description: Ensures that the game correctly alternates roles between batting and bowling for the two players across multiple overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a small number of overs, such as 2 or 3.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with player1 starting as a batter and player2 as a bowler, then alternate in the subsequent overs.
  Assert: Verify that the roles were switched correctly after each over.
Validation:
  This test checks the game's ability to handle role alternation after each over, which is fundamental to the sport of cricket and thus to the game's design.

### Scenario 3: Game Ends After All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_game_ends_when_all_wickets_lost
  Description: This test checks that the game correctly ends or stops further plays for a player once all wickets are lost, despite remaining overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the scenario such that one player loses all wickets rapidly within fewer overs than provided.
  Act: Simulate the game where a player loses all wickets before the overs are completed.
  Assert: Ensure no additional plays occur for the player who lost all wickets and the game accounts for remaining overs without that player.
Validation:
  This scenario tests a critical aspect of cricket rules implementation in the game, ensuring that wicket rules are respected, which affects game termination conditions and scoring.

### Scenario 4: Valid Score Accumulation
Details:
  TestName: test_score_accumulation_accuracy
  Description: Verifies that scores are accumulated accurately over several overs, reflecting correct updates after each play.
Execution:
  Arrange: Play a known sequence of moves over multiple overs.
  Act: Call the play_game function with predetermined inputs for batting and bowling.
  Assert: Compare the final scores with expected values calculated based on the inputs.
Validation:
  Ensuring that scores are tallied correctly after each over is fundamental to the game's integrity and user trust, validating that the game mechanics are correctly implemented.

### Scenario 5: Handling of Different Difficulty Levels
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_impact_on_gameplay
  Description: This test examines whether different difficulty settings have the expected impact on gameplay, potentially affecting randomness or decision-making algorithms.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set different difficulty levels and simulate a game for each.
  Act: Execute the play_game function under varying difficulty parameters.
  Assert: Observe and verify changes in gameplay, such as variations in opponent's play responses or scoring patterns.
Validation:
  Testing different difficulty settings is essential to ensure that the game's challenge is adjustable according to player preferences, impacting player satisfaction and game replayability.
