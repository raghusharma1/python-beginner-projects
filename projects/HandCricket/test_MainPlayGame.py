### Test Scenarios for the `play_game` Function

#### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test with Minimum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_minimum_overs
  Description: Verify that the game can be played with the minimum number of overs (1 over), and ensure scores and wickets are correctly updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game parameters with 1 over, player1 choosing to bat, and player2 choosing to bowl.
  Act: Call the `play_game` function with the specified parameters.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple of scores and that scores and wickets are logically consistent (e.g., score increments, wickets decrement on outs).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game's basic mechanics work correctly even at the minimum game length, thereby meeting the functional requirements of the game rules.

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Overs Gameplay Test
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_multiple_overs
  Description: Test the game flow with multiple overs (e.g., 5 overs) to ensure scoring and wickets are managed correctly across overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with multiple overs and predefined choices for both players.
  Act: Execute the `play_game` function and simulate user inputs for the duration.
  Assert: Verify that the final scores and remaining wickets are reasonable given the simulated inputs.
Validation:
  This test checks the game's ability to handle a typical game session, ensuring that scores accumulate and wickets reduce properly over several overs.

#### Scenario 3: All Wickets Lost Test
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_all_wickets_lost
  Description: Confirm that the game handles situations where a player loses all wickets within the given overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a scenario where one player consistently loses wickets each ball.
  Act: Play the game with this setup.
  Assert: Ensure the game ends for the player losing all wickets and scores are updated accordingly.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the game logic correctly handles the termination condition of a player losing all wickets, an essential rule of the game.

#### Scenario 4: Game Integrity with Random Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_random_choices
  Description: Test the game's integrity by simulating random choices for batting and bowling across multiple overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a game with random choices for both players over several overs.
  Act: Run the game with these random setups.
  Assert: Confirm that the game completes without errors and the results are within expected ranges.
Validation:
  Testing with random choices ensures that the game logic is robust against varied gameplay styles and inputs, confirming the game's reliability.

#### Scenario 5: Edge Case for Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_maximum_overs
  Description: Ensure the game can handle the maximum reasonable number of overs without performance degradation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game with a high number of overs (e.g., 50 overs).
  Act: Execute the `play_game` function.
  Assert: Check for smooth execution and validate the final scores and wickets.
Validation:
  This test examines the game's performance and stability under a high load, ensuring it meets usability and reliability standards.

### Comprehensive Audit Guidelines for Test Cases of the Provided Python `play_game` Function
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Completeness**: Ensure that each test case thoroughly covers different aspects of the game logic, including score calculation, wicket management, and game progression over multiple overs.
2. **Robustness**: Test cases must handle and assert correct behavior under various input conditions, including edge cases like maximum overs or all wickets lost early in the game.
3. **Performance**: Include tests that assess the game's performance and responsiveness, particularly for higher numbers of overs, to ensure that the game remains playable without significant delays.
4. **Automated Input Simulation**: Since the function involves interactive inputs (e.g., player choices), utilize mocking frameworks to simulate these inputs effectively during testing.
5. **Error Handling**: Design tests to check the function's error-handling capabilities, ensuring that it gracefully manages unexpected or invalid inputs without crashing.
6. **Documentation and Traceability**: Each test should be well-documented, explaining what aspect of the function it tests and why, ensuring traceability between test cases and functional requirements.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios provide a structured approach to thoroughly testing the `play_game` function, ensuring it meets both functional and non-functional requirements.
