Scenario 1: Validate the function's basic functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_basic_functionality
  Description: This test verifies the basic functionality of the play_game function by checking if it returns expected results for given inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the overs, player1_choice, player2_choice and difficulty parameters.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected player scores.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the basic functionality of the play_game function. The expected result is derived from the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Validate the function's response to minimal input values
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_minimal_values
  Description: This test verifies the function’s response to minimal input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the overs parameter to its minimal allowed value (0 or 1), and other parameters to their typical values.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected player scores.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's response to minimal input values. The expected result is derived from the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 3: Validate the function's response to maximal input values
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_maximal_values
  Description: This test verifies the function’s response to maximal input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the overs parameter to its maximal allowed value, and other parameters to their typical values.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns the expected player scores.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the function's response to maximal input values. The expected result is derived from the function's specifications and business requirements.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
- Correctness: The function should return the correct player scores for various inputs.
- Boundary Conditions: The function should handle minimal and maximal input values correctly.
- Error Handling: The function should handle invalid input values properly.
- Performance: The function should perform efficiently with large data sets or under stress.
- Security: The function should handle input manipulations securely, without breaching data integrity.
