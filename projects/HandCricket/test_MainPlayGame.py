### Test Scenarios for the `play_game` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test a Single Over Game with Player 1 Batting
Details:
  TestName: test_single_over_player1_batting
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a single over game where Player 1 bats first and Player 2 bowls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number of overs to 1, Player 1 choice to bat ('1'), and Player 2 choice to bowl ('2').
  Act: Call the `play_game` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Check that the scores and wickets are updated correctly and the scoreboard is displayed after the over.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game logic is correctly implemented for a minimal game scenario, validating score updates and role alternations after each over.

#### Scenario 2: Test a Multiple Overs Game with Alternating Roles
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_overs_alternating_roles
  Description: This test ensures that the game correctly alternates roles across multiple overs, with Player 1 starting as a batsman and then bowling in the next over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the overs to 2 or more, with Player 1 choosing to bat first and Player 2 to bowl.
  Act: Execute the `play_game` function with these settings.
  Assert: Verify that the roles alternate correctly and that the scores and wickets are updated after each over.
Validation:
  Validates the core functionality of role alternation in a multi-over game, ensuring that the game mechanics work over the span of multiple overs.

#### Scenario 3: Test Game Completion with All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_game_completion_all_wickets_lost
  Description: Tests that the game correctly ends and scores are finalized when all wickets are lost before the set number of overs is completed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a scenario where all wickets are likely to be lost within fewer overs than specified.
  Act: Simulate the game until all wickets are lost.
  Assert: Check that the game ends and the scores do not change after all wickets are lost.
Validation:
  Ensures that the game handles end conditions properly when all wickets are lost, which is critical for adhering to cricket game rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test Scoreboard Display After Each Over
Details:
  TestName: test_scoreboard_display_each_over
  Description: This test verifies that the scoreboard is correctly displayed after each over, showing the updated scores and wickets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game with multiple overs.
  Act: Run the game and capture the output after each over.
  Assert: Validate that the scoreboard is displayed with correct information after each over.
Validation:
  Checks the correctness and consistency of user-facing outputs, ensuring that players receive accurate game progress updates.

#### Scenario 5: Test Different Difficulty Settings
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_impact_on_game
  Description: This test checks if changing the difficulty setting affects the gameplay, potentially by influencing random outcomes or game dynamics.
Execution:
  Arrange: Play multiple games with varying difficulty levels.
  Act: Observe and record game outcomes under different difficulties.
  Assert: Analyze if and how the difficulty settings alter the game results.
Validation:
  Ensures that the difficulty parameter is functional and has a tangible effect on the game, enhancing user experience by providing varied challenge levels.

### Comprehensive Audit Guidelines for Test Cases of the Provided Python `play_game` Function

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Ensure all test scenarios:
1. Include mock inputs or stubs for user inputs and random elements to allow consistent and predictable testing outcomes.
2. Focus on the logic flow and state changes (score and wickets) rather than the specific values of random outcomes.
3. Are designed to run independently of external systems or prior test results to avoid cross-contamination of test outcomes.
4. Include assertions for both expected outcomes and error messages or handling, ensuring that the function behaves as expected even in edge cases.
5. Use detailed print statements or logging to trace the computation values step-by-step for easier debugging and validation.
6. Validate the integration and correct functioning of `play_game` with its dependent functions like `user_turn` and `display_scoreboard`, ensuring that these integrations are seamless and error-free.
END_GUIDELINE

This structured approach ensures that each test scenario is focused, actionable, and aligned with the core functionalities and requirements of the `play_game` function, providing a robust framework for quality assurance before deployment.
