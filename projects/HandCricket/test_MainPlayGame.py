Scenario 1: Validate the function's basic functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_basic_functionality
  Description: This test verifies the function's primary operation, which is to simulate a game between two players and return their final scores.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a set number of overs and player choices.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns two integer values representing the final scores of both players.
Validation:
  The test checks if the function properly simulates a game and returns the correct final scores. The function's main purpose is to simulate a game, so it's crucial to verify that it does this correctly.

Scenario 2: Test the function with the maximum number of overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_max_overs
  Description: This test checks the function's performance when given the maximum number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a maximum number of overs and player choices.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns two integer values representing the final scores of both players.
Validation:
  The test checks if the function can handle a game with the maximum number of overs without causing any errors or performance issues. This is important to ensure the function's robustness and efficiency.

Scenario 3: Test the function with the minimum number of overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_min_overs
  Description: This test checks the function's performance when given the minimum number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a minimum number of overs and player choices.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function returns two integer values representing the final scores of both players.
Validation:
  The test checks if the function can handle a game with the minimum number of overs without causing any errors or performance issues. This is important to ensure the function's robustness and efficiency.

Scenario 4: Test the function's error handling
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_error_handling
  Description: This test checks the function's error handling by providing it with invalid player choices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the function with a set number of overs and invalid player choices.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared parameters.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  The test checks if the function properly handles errors when given invalid inputs. This is important to ensure the function's robustness and prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
  Correctness: The function should return the correct final scores for both players.
  Boundary Conditions: The function should be able to handle both the minimum and maximum number of overs.
  Error Handling: The function should raise an appropriate error when given invalid player choices.
  Performance: The function should not cause any performance issues, even when given the maximum number of overs.
  Security: The function should not allow any input manipulations that could breach data integrity or security.
