### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test with Minimum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_minimum_overs
  Description: Verify that the game can handle the minimum number of overs (1 over game) and completes without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number of overs to 1, and player choices for batting and bowling.
  Act: Call the play_game function with the specified parameters.
  Assert: Check if the game returns two integers representing the scores of player 1 and player 2.
Validation:
  Testing a game with a minimal number of overs checks the function's capability to handle the smallest valid input and ensures that the game logic processes at least one complete cycle of batting and bowling correctly.

### Scenario 2: Normal Game Play with Multiple Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_multiple_overs
  Description: Ensure that the game functions correctly over multiple overs (e.g., 5 overs) and accumulates scores properly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number of overs to 5, and determine player choices.
  Act: Execute the play_game function with the set parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned scores are integers and check if they logically reflect the number of overs played.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the game's loop through multiple overs works as expected and that score accumulation over these overs is consistent with game rules.

### Scenario 3: Check Score Accuracy When All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_score_accuracy_when_all_wickets_lost
  Description: Test the game's behavior if a player loses all wickets before the game ends.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set conditions leading to the quick loss of wickets for one player.
  Act: Run play_game to simulate this condition.
  Assert: Confirm that no additional runs are scored after all wickets are lost and that the game proceeds without interruption.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the game correctly handles the scenario where a player is out before all overs are completed, ensuring the integrity of the scoring system under such circumstances.

### Scenario 4: Game Behavior with Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_maximum_overs
  Description: Verify that the game can handle a larger number of overs (e.g., 20 overs) and maintains performance without degradation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number of overs to 20 and player choices.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function.
  Assert: Check the game completes within a reasonable time and returns valid scores.
Validation:
  This test ensures the game's scalability and performance are maintained with larger inputs, which is essential for real-world usability.

### Scenario 5: Validating Scoreboard Display Functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_scoreboard_display_each_over
  Description: Ensure that the scoreboard is displayed correctly after each over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a moderate number of overs (e.g., 3 overs), and mock the display_scoreboard function to capture its outputs.
  Act: Run the play_game function and capture the output of each scoreboard display.
  Assert: Verify that the scoreboard is displayed correctly after each over with the correct scores and over number.
Validation:
  This test is critical for confirming that the visual feedback via the scoreboard is correct and informative, enhancing user experience and understanding of the game status.

These scenarios comprehensively evaluate the play_game function's robustness, correctness, and user interface, ensuring that the game meets the expected functional requirements and provides a seamless and engaging user experience.
