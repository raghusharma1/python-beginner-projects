BEGIN_GUIDELINE
- **Correctness**: The test should ensure that the function `play_game` correctly computes scores based on the game logic defined in `user_turn`. Each test should verify that the score and wickets are updated appropriately after each over and at the end of the game.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Testing should include scenarios with minimal input (e.g., 1 over) and maximal input (e.g., the maximum reasonable number of overs a game might realistically have). Boundary conditions should also test the game with minimal and maximal difficulty settings if applicable.
- **Error Handling**: The function should be tested for its handling of non-integer and out-of-bound values for `overs`. Although Python is dynamically typed, the function's logic should gracefully handle or reject non-sensical values like negative overs or non-numeric choices.
- **Performance**: The function should be tested for performance by simulating a game with a high number of overs to ensure that it executes within acceptable time limits and does not consume excessive resources.
- **Security**: Input manipulation testing is less relevant here due to the nature of the function, but tests should ensure that the function does not expose any sensitive data, especially when simulating user input for choices in `user_turn`.

```
Scenario 1: Basic Functionality with Minimal Input
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_one_over
  Description: Test the play_game function with the minimal number of overs (1 over) to ensure basic functionality.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with 1 over, player1_choice as "1" (batting), and player2_choice as "2" (bowling).
  Act: Call play_game(1, "1", "2").
  Assert: Check that the function returns a tuple of two integers (scores), and that both scores are non-negative.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the game can complete a minimal viable game and correctly returns the scores, ensuring the game's basic logic and loop control work as expected.

Scenario 2: Player Roles Switched
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_player_roles_switched
  Description: Verify that the game correctly handles role switching where player 1 starts as bowler and player 2 as batsman.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the game with player1_choice as "2" and player2_choice as "1".
  Act: Call play_game(2, "2", "1").
  Assert: Validate that the returned scores are integers and check the game does not end prematurely.
Validation:
  Testing role reversals is crucial to ensure that the logic handles both configurations (player 1 batting first and player 1 bowling first) correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for Maximum Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_maximum_overs
  Description: Test the function with a high number of overs to evaluate performance and correctness under extended play.
Execution:
  Arrange: Setup the game with a high number of overs, e.g., 50.
  Act: Call play_game(50, "1", "2").
  Assert: Ensure the function completes within a reasonable time and returns correct score formats.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle a large input size, testing both performance and the cumulative correctness of scoring over many overs.

Scenario 4: Edge Case with Zero Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_with_zero_overs
  Description: Test how the function behaves when the number of overs is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with 0 overs.
  Act: Call play_game(0, "1", "2").
  Assert: Expect the function to return (0, 0) since no game is played.
Validation:
  Ensures the function gracefully handles edge cases where the game setup might not logically proceed, such as a game set with no overs.
```
These scenarios provide a comprehensive assessment of the `play_game` function under various conditions, ensuring robustness and correctness in diverse situations.
