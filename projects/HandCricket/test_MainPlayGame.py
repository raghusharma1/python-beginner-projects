### Scenario 1: Basic Gameplay Flow with Minimum Overs and Player Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_basic_gameplay_flow
  Description: Verify that the game correctly handles the minimum number of overs (1 over game) and checks the flow when both players choose batting first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with 1 over, player1 choosing to bat first, and player2 choosing to bowl first.
  Act: Call the play_game function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that both players' scores and wickets are updated correctly after one over.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the basic gameplay logic adheres to the rules of the game under standard conditions. It tests the function's ability to manage game state across a single over, ensuring the correct alternation of roles (batting/bowling) and proper score and wicket tallying.

### Scenario 2: Multiple Overs Gameplay Consistency
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_overs_gameplay_consistency
  Description: Test the game consistency over multiple overs (e.g., 5 overs) to ensure scores and wickets are accumulated and tracked correctly across overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game with multiple overs (e.g., 5), with player1 batting first.
  Act: Execute the play_game function with these settings.
  Assert: Check if the score and wickets are consistent and logical given the number of overs played.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the game's ability to handle longer matches, ensuring that scores and wickets are accurately maintained over multiple overs, which is crucial for the game's credibility and the user's trust in the game mechanics.

### Scenario 3: Edge Case of Zero Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_overs_edge_case
  Description: Ensure that the game handles a scenario where the number of overs is set to zero, which should ideally result in no gameplay.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with 0 overs.
  Act: Run the play_game function.
  Assert: Confirm that both players' scores and wickets remain at their initial values (0 score and 10 wickets).
Validation:
  Testing zero overs checks the function's robustness in handling edge cases, ensuring that it does not proceed with gameplay when the number of overs is not positive.

### Scenario 4: Player Choices Impact on Game Dynamics
Details:
  TestName: test_player_choices_impact_on_game_dynamics
  Description: Examine the game dynamics when players switch their roles (batting/bowling) in subsequent overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure a 2-over game where player1 bats first in the first over and bowls first in the second.
  Act: Play the game with these settings.
  Assert: Validate the correct alternation of roles and corresponding impact on scores and wickets.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify that the game logic correctly handles role switching between overs, an essential feature for gameplay variety and strategic depth.

### Scenario 5: Game Ending Conditions Verification
Details:
  TestName: test_game_ending_conditions
  Description: Validate that the game ends correctly after the designated number of overs is played, and the final scores are correctly reported.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game with a predefined number of overs (e.g., 3 overs).
  Act: Complete the game.
  Assert: Ensure that the game does not proceed beyond the specified overs and that the final scores are accurately reflected.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the game respects the initial conditions regarding the length of the match, which is essential for tournament settings and respecting player time commitments.
