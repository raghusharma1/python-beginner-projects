Scenario 1: Player 1 bats first and scores more runs
Details:
  TestName: test_player1_bats_first_and_scores_more
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the play_game function correctly plays out the game when Player 1 bats first and scores more runs than Player 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the number of overs, player1_choice as "1" (batting), and player2_choice as "2" (bowling). Mock the random function to return predetermined values for player runs.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned player1_score is greater than player2_score.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the game logic correctly calculates and returns the scores when Player 1 bats first and scores more runs, ensuring accurate game results.

Scenario 2: Player 2 bats first and scores more runs
Details:
  TestName: test_player2_bats_first_and_scores_more
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the play_game function correctly plays out the game when Player 2 bats first and scores more runs than Player 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the number of overs, player1_choice as "2" (bowling), and player2_choice as "1" (batting). Mock the random function to return predetermined values for player runs.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned player2_score is greater than player1_score.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the game logic correctly calculates and returns the scores when Player 2 bats first and scores more runs, ensuring accurate game results.

Scenario 3: Player 1 and Player 2 score equal runs
Details:
  TestName: test_equal_scores
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the play_game function correctly handles the situation where both players score equal runs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the number of overs, player1_choice as "1" (batting), and player2_choice as "2" (bowling). Mock the random function to return predetermined equal values for player runs.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned player1_score and player2_score are equal.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the game logic correctly handles the situation where both players score equal runs, ensuring accurate game results.

Scenario 4: Player loses all wickets
Details:
  TestName: test_player_loses_all_wickets
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the play_game function correctly handles the situation where a player loses all wickets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the number of overs, player1_choice as "1" (batting), and player2_choice as "2" (bowling). Mock the random function and user input to return predetermined values that result in a player losing all wickets.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with the initialized parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned player1_score or player2_score is less than expected due to the loss of all wickets.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the game logic correctly handles the situation where a player loses all wickets, ensuring accurate game results and enforcing the rules of the game.
