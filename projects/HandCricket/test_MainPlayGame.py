BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Correctness: Ensure that `play_game` accurately calculates scores based on the number of overs, player choices, and simulated outcomes of each ball. Tests should validate that scores and wickets are updated correctly after each over and that the final scores reflect the entire game's events, adhering to the rules of cricket.

Boundary Conditions: Test `play_game` with minimal input values such as 1 over and maximal values like 50 overs to ensure stability and correctness under different game lengths. Also, check behavior when player choices are at their limits (e.g., consistent batting or bowling).

Error Handling: Although the scenario specifies not to focus on input types, ensure that the function handles unexpected values gracefully, such as non-integer inputs for overs or invalid strings for player choices. These can be simulated or mocked if necessary.

Performance: Assess the function's performance when subjected to a high number of overs, ensuring that there are no significant delays or memory issues, which might indicate inefficient loops or recursion.

Security: Verify that the function does not expose any sensitive data during its execution and that it cannot be interrupted or altered by external inputs during its runtime, maintaining the integrity of the game's logic and outcomes.
END_GUIDELINE

Scenario 1: Normal game flow with alternating choices
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_game_flow
  Description: Test the `play_game` function with an equal number of overs where players alternate their roles (batting/bowling) to ensure the game logic correctly handles role switching.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game with a moderate number of overs (e.g., 5) and alternating player choices.
  Act: Invoke `play_game` with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the final scores and remaining wickets are logically consistent with the game play.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality of alternating roles between batting and bowling is handled correctly, reflecting typical gameplay scenarios.

Scenario 2: All overs with batting first
Details:
  TestName: test_all_batting_first
  Description: Verify that when a player consistently chooses to bat first throughout all overs, the game logic correctly accumulates scores and adjusts wickets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the game for a few overs with one player always batting first.
  Act: Run `play_game` and monitor score changes and wicket counts.
  Assert: Check that scores and wickets are updated properly after each over.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the persistence and consistency of game state across multiple overs under a consistent game strategy, highlighting correctness in scorekeeping.

Scenario 3: Zero overs game
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_overs
  Description: Ensure the function can handle a game setup with zero overs, which should result in no changes in scores or wickets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the game with zero overs.
  Act: Execute `play_game` and capture the outputs.
  Assert: Confirm that the scores and wickets remain at their initial state.
Validation:
  Testing with zero overs verifies the function's ability to handle edge cases in game length, ensuring robustness in minimal input scenarios.

Scenario 4: High number of overs
Details:
  TestName: test_high_number_of_overs
  Description: Test the function's performance and correctness over a large number of overs to simulate a longer game.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game with a high number of overs (e.g., 50).
  Act: Run `play_game` and measure execution time and resource usage.
  Assert: Verify that the game completes within a reasonable time and that the scores and wickets are logically consistent.
Validation:
  This scenario assesses both performance under stress and correctness in maintaining game state across an extended period, which is crucial for real-world usability and stability.

Scenario 5: Invalid player choices
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_player_choices
  Description: Check how the game handles invalid inputs for player choices.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide non-standard strings for player choices.
  Act: Attempt to start the game with these invalid choices.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the situation gracefully, possibly by defaulting to valid values or aborting with an error.
Validation:
  Ensuring robust error handling for invalid inputs is essential for maintaining game integrity and user experience.
