### Scenario 1: Basic Play Game Functionality with Equal Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_basic_equal_choices
  Description: Test the play_game function with both players choosing the same strategy (batting or bowling) to ensure the game logic handles scoring and wickets correctly through multiple overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose the number of overs and identical choices for both players.
  Act: Call the play_game function with the parameters set for equal choices.
  Assert: Check that the game progresses through the specified number of overs and updates scores and wickets accurately.
Validation:
  This test validates the core functionality of the play_game function, ensuring that it correctly alternates turns and calculates scores and wickets when both players choose the same strategy. This scenario is crucial for confirming that basic game mechanics work as expected.

### Scenario 2: Play Game with Different Choices
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_different_choices
  Description: Verify that the play_game function correctly handles scenarios where players choose different strategies (one bats and the other bowls).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the number of overs and different choices for each player.
  Act: Invoke the play_game function with one player batting and the other bowling.
  Assert: Confirm that the game correctly alternates player roles and updates scores and wickets based on the differing strategies.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the game logic robustly handles different strategies, which is essential for the game's dynamic nature and strategic depth. It tests the function's ability to adapt to different game situations.

### Scenario 3: Play Game Over Multiple Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_multiple_overs
  Description: Test the functionality of play_game over a larger number of overs to ensure that the game maintains state correctly over time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a higher number of overs to extend game duration.
  Act: Execute the play_game function with a significant number of overs.
  Assert: Verify that scores and wickets are tracked and updated correctly across all overs.
Validation:
  Testing the game over multiple overs is critical to ensure that longer gameplay is supported and that state management (scores and wickets) is consistent. This test simulates a real-game scenario and checks for potential fatigue errors in logic.

### Scenario 4: Play Game with Zero Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_zero_overs
  Description: Check how play_game handles a scenario where the number of overs is set to zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set overs parameter to zero.
  Act: Run the play_game function.
  Assert: Ensure no changes in scores or wickets, and the game ends immediately.
Validation:
  This edge case tests the function's robustness against unusual but valid input, ensuring that the game does not enter an invalid state or throw errors when no play is required.

### Scenario 5: Handling of All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_play_game_all_wickets_lost
  Description: Test the play_game function's response when all wickets are lost before the game is officially over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a game scenario where one player loses all wickets quickly.
  Act: Simulate the game where one player rapidly loses all wickets.
  Assert: Confirm that the game handles this situation gracefully, potentially ending the game early if all wickets are lost.
Validation:
  This test checks the game's ability to handle scenarios where a player is out of wickets, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of game rules and ensuring the game concludes correctly.

Each of these scenarios helps ensure that the `play_game` function behaves as expected across a range of normal and edge cases, contributing to a robust and enjoyable game experience.
