### Scenario 1: Batting Mode with No Outs
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_mode_no_outs
  Description: Tests the function when the player is batting and does not get out over six balls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice for batting, and over number. Mock input values for batting and random values for the opponent to ensure no outs.
  Act: Call the user_turn function with the prepared inputs.
  Assert: Check that the player's score is updated correctly and no wickets are lost.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly accumulates runs when the player is batting and does not mistakenly count outs when runs do not match the opponent's.

### Scenario 2: Bowling Mode with One Out
Details:
  TestName: test_bowling_mode_one_out
  Description: Verify the function when the player is bowling and the opponent gets out once.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set initial score and wickets, player_choice for bowling, and over number. Mock inputs for opponent's choice and player's delivery to simulate an out.
  Act: Run the function with the specified parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the playerâ€™s wickets are decremented by one and the score remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly handles the scenario where the opponent is out while the player is bowling, ensuring that wickets are properly managed.

### Scenario 3: All Balls Bowled in an Over
Details:
  TestName: test_complete_over_batting
  Description: Ensures the function can handle a full over of six balls without any outs when the player is batting.
Execution:
  Arrange: Player starts with a specific score and number of wickets, chooses to bat, and is in a specific over. Mock inputs to avoid outs.
  Act: Invoke the function and let it process all six balls.
  Assert: Verify that six balls are processed and the score is updated accordingly without losing any wickets.
Validation:
  Validates that the function can manage a full over, correctly counting balls and updating the score, crucial for maintaining accurate game progress.

### Scenario 4: Player Loses All Wickets While Batting
Details:
  TestName: test_player_loses_all_wickets_batting
  Description: Test the scenario where the player loses all available wickets in less than six balls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize with a set score, multiple wickets, choice of batting, and mock inputs to simulate the player getting out on each ball.
  Act: Execute the function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the wickets are reduced to zero and the score remains largely unchanged.
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring the game correctly handles the situation of a player losing all wickets, which should end the batting turn prematurely.

### Scenario 5: Invalid Player Choices Handled
Details:
  TestName: test_handle_invalid_player_choices
  Description: Assess how the function deals with invalid inputs for player choices, such as inputs other than '1' or '2'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up player score, wickets, an invalid player_choice, and mock corresponding inputs.
  Act: Attempt to run the function with these parameters.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle unexpected inputs gracefully without crashing or incorrect behavior.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness of the function in face of user input errors, important for maintaining game integrity and user experience.
