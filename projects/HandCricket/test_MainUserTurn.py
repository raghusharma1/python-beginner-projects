Scenario 1: Player batting and gets out
Details:
  TestName: test_player_batting_and_gets_out
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the player is declared out when the player's run matches the opponent's run while batting.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '1' for batting, and over.
  Act: Invoke the function user_turn with the initialized values. Manipulate the input to return a specific run number for both the player and the opponent.
  Assert: Check if the player_wickets is reduced by 1.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the correct implementation of the rule that the player is declared out when the player's run matches the opponent's run while batting.

Scenario 2: Player bowling and opponent gets out
Details:
  TestName: test_player_bowling_and_opponent_gets_out
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the opponent is declared out when the player's run matches the opponent's run while bowling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '2' for bowling, and over. Also, ensure that the opponent chooses to bat.
  Act: Invoke the function user_turn with the initialized values. Manipulate the input to return a specific run number for both the player and the opponent.
  Assert: Check if the player_wickets is reduced by 1.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the correct implementation of the rule that the opponent is declared out when the player's run matches the opponent's run while bowling.

Scenario 3: Player scores runs
Details:
  TestName: test_player_scores_runs
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the player's score increases when the player's run does not match the opponent's run.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice, and over.
  Act: Invoke the function user_turn with the initialized values. Manipulate the input to return different run numbers for the player and the opponent.
  Assert: Check if the player_score increases by the player's run.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the correct implementation of the rule that the player's score increases when the player's run does not match the opponent's run.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Correctness: The tests should ensure that the function correctly implements the rules of the game. This includes declaring a player or opponent out and increasing the player's score.
Boundary Conditions: The tests should also check the function's response to the minimal and maximal values of player_score, player_wickets, and over.
Error Handling: The tests should verify that the function handles invalid input values correctly. This includes invalid values for player_choice and the run numbers.
Performance: The efficiency of the function should be assessed with large data sets or under stress. This includes a large number of overs or a high number of wickets.
Security: The tests should check if any input manipulations can breach data integrity or security. This includes manipulating the input to return specific run numbers for the player and the opponent.
