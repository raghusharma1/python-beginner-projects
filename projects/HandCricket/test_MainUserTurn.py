### Scenario 1: Batting Mode with No Outs
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_mode_no_outs
  Description: Tests the function when the player is batting and does not get out over six balls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '1' (batting), and over. Mock input to always provide unique runs different from the opponent's random output.
  Act: Call the function `user_turn` with the initialized variables.
  Assert: Ensure that the player's score is incremented correctly after six balls and wickets remain unchanged.
Validation:
  Rationalizing this test ensures that the function handles the accumulation of runs correctly and respects the wicket count when no outs occur, aligning with cricket scoring rules.

### Scenario 2: Bowling Mode with Outs
Details:
  TestName: test_bowling_mode_with_outs
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when the player is bowling and the opponent gets out.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '2' (bowling), and over. Mock inputs to simulate the opponent choosing to bowl and getting the same runs as the player randomly, leading to an out.
  Act: Call the function `user_turn` with the specified parameters.
  Assert: Check that the player_wickets is decremented and that the player_score remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test checks the wicket decrement logic in bowling mode, ensuring that outs are correctly processed and scores are correctly maintained, which is crucial for the integrity of the game's mechanics.

### Scenario 3: Full Over Completed
Details:
  TestName: test_full_over_completion
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly handles the scenario where a full over of six balls is played without any outs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player_score, player_wickets, player_choice, over. Mock inputs to ensure no outs occur (i.e., player and opponent choose different runs).
  Act: Run user_turn and count the number of balls played.
  Assert: Verify that exactly six balls were played and that the score and wickets are updated accordingly.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function respects the six-ball limit per over is essential for adhering to the standard rules of cricket, making this test critical for verifying game flow control.

### Scenario 4: Wicket Loss in First Ball
Details:
  TestName: test_wicket_loss_first_ball
  Description: Checks the behavior when the player loses a wicket on the first ball.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize variables with player choosing batting, and mock inputs such that the player and opponent choose the same run on the first ball.
  Act: Execute user_turn and capture the output.
  Assert: Confirm that the wickets are reduced by one and the score has not increased.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify that the function correctly handles the scenario of an early wicket, which impacts the strategic decisions in subsequent plays.

### Scenario 5: Change of Roles Between Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_role_change_between_overs
  Description: Ensures the function can handle changes in roles (batting to bowling or vice versa) between overs without error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Run the function once with batting, then run it again with bowling, using modified initial conditions from the first run.
  Act: Invoke the function twice with the described setups.
  Assert: Check that player scores and wickets are correctly tracked across the role change.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's flexibility and correctness across multiple game phases, which is vital for a dynamic and variable game setup like cricket.
