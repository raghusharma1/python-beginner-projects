### Scenario 1: Batting Mode with No Outs
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_mode_no_outs
  Description: Tests the function when the player is batting and does not get out over six balls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '1' (batting), and over. Mock input to always provide unique runs different from the opponent's random output.
  Act: Call the function `user_turn` with the initialized variables.
  Assert: Ensure that the player's score is incremented correctly after six balls and wickets remain unchanged.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly updates the score during the batting mode without any outs, confirming the scoring logic and wicket counting is accurate when the player's and opponent's runs do not match.

### Scenario 2: Bowling Mode with One Out
Details:
  TestName: test_bowling_mode_one_out
  Description: Tests the function when the player is bowling and the opponent gets out once.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '2' (bowling), and over. Mock inputs for opponent_choice as '2' (bat) and player delivery so that player_runs match opponent_runs once.
  Act: Call `user_turn` with the provided parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the player's score remains unchanged, and the wickets are reduced by one.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles an out in bowling mode and properly updates the wickets count, confirming the functionality of wicket decrement and score maintenance when the player is bowling.

### Scenario 3: Batting Mode with All Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_all_wickets_lost
  Description: Tests the function when the player is batting and loses all wickets within the over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets as a low number, player_choice as '1', and over. Mock inputs to match player_runs with opponent_runs for each ball.
  Act: Execute the function `user_turn`.
  Assert: Ensure that the game stops when all wickets are lost and verify that the score remains unchanged from the initial.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's ability to correctly handle the scenario where all wickets are lost, ensuring the game stops appropriately and that wickets and scores are updated correctly.

### Scenario 4: Mixed Outcomes in Batting Mode
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_mixed_outcomes
  Description: Tests the function with a mix of scoring runs and getting out in batting mode.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set initial player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '1', and over. Mock inputs to alternate between matching and not matching the opponent's runs.
  Act: Call `user_turn` with these settings.
  Assert: Confirm that the score increases correctly for unmatched runs and wickets decrease for matches.
Validation:
  This tests the function's ability to handle alternating conditions of outs and scoring, ensuring that both score increments and wicket decrements are handled correctly in a dynamic game setting.

### Scenario 5: Error Handling with Invalid Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_handling
  Description: Ensures that the function handles invalid inputs gracefully during batting.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize player_score, player_wickets, player_choice as '1', and over. Mock input to provide invalid non-integer values.
  Act: Attempt to call `user_turn` and catch any exceptions.
  Assert: Check that appropriate exceptions are raised and the game state remains unaffected.
Validation:
  Validates the robustness of the function in dealing with user input errors, ensuring that the game does not crash and maintains a consistent state in the face of invalid input.
