### Scenario 1: Batting Mode with No Wickets Lost
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_no_wickets_lost
  Description: This test verifies that the player's score increases appropriately when batting and not losing any wickets during the over.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player_choice to '1' (batting), initialize player_score and player_wickets, and mock user input and random opponent responses to ensure no wickets are lost.
  Act: Call the `user_turn` function with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Check that the player's score has increased by the sum of the runs scored in each valid input, and player_wickets remain unchanged.
Validation:
  Testing that the score accumulates correctly and wickets remain constant when no out conditions are met is essential to ensure the game's scoring mechanics function as expected.

### Scenario 2: Bowling Mode with Opponent Out
Details:
  TestName: test_bowling_opponent_out
  Description: This test ensures that the opponent loses a wicket when the player is bowling, and both choose the same number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player_choice to '2' (bowling), mock user inputs and random choices to create a scenario where opponent gets out.
  Act: Call `user_turn` function with the setup.
  Assert: Verify that the opponent's wickets are reduced by one and the score remains unchanged.
Validation:
  Crucial for validating the out mechanism in bowling mode, ensuring that game rules regarding outs are properly implemented.

### Scenario 3: Batting Mode with Player Out
Details:
  TestName: test_batting_player_out
  Description: Checks if the player loses a wicket when batting, and player and opponent choose the same number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player_choice to '1' (batting), and mock inputs to simulate the player getting out.
  Act: Invoke the `user_turn` function.
  Assert: Confirm that player_wickets is decremented by one and the score does not change.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the out mechanism while batting is correctly implemented, reflecting a realistic cricket match scenario.

### Scenario 4: Full Over Completion
Details:
  TestName: test_full_over_completion
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles the transition through a full over of six balls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up conditions for six different outcomes within an over, with mixed results of scores and outs.
  Act: Run `user_turn` function to simulate a full over.
  Assert: Check that the number of balls bowled equals six and validate changes in score and wickets according to inputs.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function can handle a full over properly, which is critical for game progression and over management.

### Scenario 5: Game Continuation Despite Outs
Details:
  TestName: test_continuation_after_outs
  Description: Ensures the game continues correctly as long as there are remaining wickets, even after one or more outs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set player_choice, mock multiple outs but keep wickets above zero.
  Act: Execute `user_turn` multiple times if necessary.
  Assert: Confirm that game continues until wickets are exhausted, and validate the final scores and wickets.
Validation:
  Tests the robustness of the game's continuation logic, ensuring that play does not halt prematurely due to outs as long as wickets remain.
