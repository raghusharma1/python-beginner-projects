BEGIN_GUIDELINE
Correctness:
- The function should correctly handle valid user inputs (1 for heads, 2 for tails) and produce the correct output based on the random toss result.
- Ensure that the function matches the user's choice with the random result correctly and returns the appropriate win indicator (1 for user win, 2 for opponent win).

Boundary Conditions:
- Since the input is expected to be either 1 or 2, there isn't a traditional boundary condition as seen in numerical ranges. However, ensure the function handles the lowest and highest valid inputs (1 and 2).

Error Handling:
- Although the task specifies not to focus on input data types, it's crucial to ensure the function behaves gracefully when given unexpected string representations of numbers or completely invalid inputs like strings that cannot be converted to integers.

Performance:
- Given the simplicity of the function (a single random number generation and basic conditional checks), performance tests are less critical but can include stress testing by repeatedly calling the function to ensure stability over time.

Security:
- Evaluate the function's resilience against injection-like attacks through the input() function, though this is generally more of an environment or framework concern rather than something typically tested with unit tests in Python.
END_GUIDELINE

Scenario 1: Correct input with user guessing heads correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_user_wins_guessing_heads
  Description: Validates that the function returns 1 (user wins) when the user guesses heads and the random toss results in heads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to be '1' and the random.randint function to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 1.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that when the user's guess matches the random result, the function acknowledges the user's win correctly.

Scenario 2: Correct input with user guessing tails correctly
Details:
  TestName: test_user_wins_guessing_tails
  Description: Validates that the function returns 1 (user wins) when the user guesses tails and the random toss results in tails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to be '2' and the random.randint function to return 2.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly handles the scenario where the user correctly guesses tails.

Scenario 3: User loses the toss
Details:
  TestName: test_user_loses_toss
  Description: Validates that the function returns 2 (opponent wins) when the user's guess does not match the random toss result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to be '1' and the random.randint function to return 2.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle situations where the user's guess is incorrect, ensuring that losses are processed correctly.

Scenario 4: Invalid input handling
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_handling
  Description: Ensures that the function handles non-integer and out-of-bound inputs gracefully, possibly by raising an error or re-prompting the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return a non-integer value or an out-of-bound integer.
  Act: Call the toss function under these conditions.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised or check for any other defined error handling behavior.
Validation:
  Testing how the function handles invalid input is crucial for maintaining robustness and preventing crashes or undefined behavior in production.
