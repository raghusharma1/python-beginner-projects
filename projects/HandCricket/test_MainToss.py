### Test Scenarios for the `toss` Function

#### Scenario 1: Correct User Choice Leads to Player 1 Winning
Details:
  TestName: test_player_one_wins_with_correct_guess
  Description: This test verifies that when the user correctly guesses the outcome of the toss, the function returns 1, indicating that player 1 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user selecting "heads" and the random function to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function adheres to the game rule where a correct guess by the user results in a win for player 1. It validates that the function accurately assesses user input against the toss outcome.

#### Scenario 2: Incorrect User Choice Leads to Player 2 Winning
Details:
  TestName: test_player_two_wins_with_incorrect_guess
  Description: This test confirms that when the user guesses the toss outcome incorrectly, the function returns 2, indicating that player 2 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for user choice as "tails" and set the random function to return 1 (heads).
  Act: Execute the toss function.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This scenario checks that the function correctly implements the rule that an incorrect guess results in a win for player 2. It is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the game's rules.

#### Scenario 3: Function Outputs Correct Result Announcement
Details:
  TestName: test_output_correct_announcement
  Description: Ensures that the function prints the correct result announcement based on the toss outcome.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input and random.randint to control the toss outcome and capture the printed output.
  Act: Run the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the correct announcement is printed ("It's Heads!" or "It's Tails!").
Validation:
  Verifying the correctness of output messages is essential for user experience and confirms that the function communicates the result effectively to the user.

### Comprehensive Audit Guidelines for Test Cases of the Provided Python `toss` Function
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
- **Input Mocking**: Since `input()` and `random.randint()` are used, tests must mock these to simulate user input and random outcomes without actual user interaction or random behavior during tests.
- **Output Capturing**: Tests should capture outputs to verify that the function prints the correct statements to the console, ensuring the function's feedback loop is correct.
- **Return Value Verification**: Each test must verify the return value of the `toss` function to ensure it conforms to the expected game logic (1 for player 1 win, 2 for player 2 win).
- **Robust Mocking**: Ensure that mocks are correctly set up and torn down for each test to prevent side effects in other tests.
- **Error Handling**: Although the prompt suggests not focusing on input data types, ensuring that non-integer inputs are gracefully handled (either through additional function logic or testing) could be considered for comprehensive coverage.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for full path coverage, including all branches in conditional statements.
- **Documentation and Comments**: Each test should be well-documented explaining the rationale, which aids in maintenance and scalability of test cases.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios ensure that the tests are robust, error-free, and provide comprehensive coverage of the `toss` function's business logic and behavior.
