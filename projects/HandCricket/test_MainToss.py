### Scenario 1: User Chooses Heads and Wins
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_heads_and_wins
  Description: This test verifies that when the user selects "heads" (1) and the random toss also results in "heads" (1), the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to always choose "heads" (1) and the random number generator to always return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1.
Validation:
  This test is important as it ensures that the game logic correctly identifies and announces the winner based on matching toss outcomes. It validates that the function's handling of user input and random outcomes aligns with the expected game rules.

### Scenario 2: User Chooses Tails and Loses
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_tails_and_loses
  Description: Tests the scenario where the user selects "tails" (2) but the toss results in "heads" (1), resulting in the user losing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to always choose "tails" (2) and the random number generator to always return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 2.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the game accurately processes losing conditions when the user's choice does not match the toss result. It ensures the robustness of the game's decision-making logic under mismatched conditions.

### Scenario 3: Invalid User Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_user_input
  Description: Ensures that the function handles invalid input gracefully. This test checks the function's resilience when faced with inputs other than 1 or 2.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide an invalid choice (e.g., '3', '0', 'heads').
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: The function should handle the situation without crashing and possibly prompt for correct input again or default to a valid decision.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's error handling capabilities, ensuring that the game remains user-friendly and error-resistant when faced with unexpected or incorrect input.

### Scenario 4: Randomness of Toss
Details:
  TestName: test_randomness_of_toss
  Description: Verifies that the toss results are not biased or predictable, ensuring fair play.
Execution:
  Arrange: Run the toss function a statistically significant number of times (e.g., 1000 times).
  Act: Record the results of each toss.
  Assert: Analyze the distribution of results to confirm that both outcomes (1 and 2) appear in approximately equal proportion.
Validation:
  This test checks the fairness and unpredictability of the toss result, crucial for the integrity of the game. Ensuring a nearly even distribution of outcomes validates that the random number generator functions as expected.

### Scenario 5: Continuous Play Without Interruption
Details:
  TestName: test_continuous_play_without_interruption
  Description: Tests the function's ability to handle multiple consecutive executions without failure, simulating a real game environment.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a loop to call the toss function multiple times (e.g., 10 times).
  Act: Execute the loop.
  Assert: Ensure that the function completes all iterations without errors and correctly displays results each time.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's reliability and performance under continuous use, which is essential for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction during extended play sessions.
