### Scenario 1: User Chooses Heads and Wins
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_heads_and_wins
  Description: This test verifies that when the user selects "heads" (1) and the random toss also results in "heads" (1), the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to always return "1" and the random.randint function to also return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 1, indicating the user has won.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toss function correctly interprets both the user's choice and the toss result, awarding the win to the user when both match. This aligns with the game's rules where the correct guess wins.

### Scenario 2: User Chooses Tails and Loses
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_tails_and_loses
  Description: This test checks the scenario where the user selects "tails" (2), but the random toss results in "heads" (1), leading to the user's loss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to always return "2" and the random.randint function to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 2, indicating the opponent wins.
Validation:
  Validates that the function handles discrepancies between user choice and toss result properly by not awarding a win to the user. Ensures the integrity of the game's loss condition.

### Scenario 3: User Enters Invalid Choice
Details:
  TestName: test_user_enters_invalid_choice
  Description: This test ensures that the function handles situations where the user enters a choice that is neither "1" nor "2".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return a value not equal to "1" or "2", for instance "3".
  Act: Call the toss function, ideally within a try-except block to handle potential errors.
  Assert: The function should ideally raise a ValueError or handle the input gracefully.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function against invalid inputs, ensuring that the game prompts correctly or handles such situations without crashing. Important for maintaining user experience and game integrity.

### Scenario 4: Coincidental Match of User Choice and Toss Result
Details:
  TestName: test_coincidental_match_of_choice_and_result
  Description: This test verifies that the function can handle multiple consecutive inputs where the user's choice and the toss result match consistently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input and random.randint to return the same value consistently over multiple executions.
  Act: Execute the toss function multiple times.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 1 each time, indicating the user wins each toss.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function provides consistent results in scenarios of repeated user success, which is critical for user trust and game reliability.

### Scenario 5: Randomness of Toss Function
Details:
  TestName: test_randomness_of_toss_function
  Description: This test checks whether the toss function produces an approximately equal distribution of heads and tails over a large number of executions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Execute the toss function a significant number of times (e.g., 1000 times).
  Act: Record the results of each toss.
  Assert: Analyze the distribution to confirm it is close to 50/50.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the random number generation within the toss function is fair and unbiased, which is fundamental for the game's fairness.
