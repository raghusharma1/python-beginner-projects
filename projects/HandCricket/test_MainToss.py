### Scenario 1: User correctly guesses heads
Details:
  TestName: test_user_correctly_guesses_heads
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies when the user has guessed heads and the toss result is indeed heads, leading to a win for the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "1" and `random.randint` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1, indicating the user won.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function correctly processes a correct guess and the logic to determine the winner functions as expected when the user and toss result align.

### Scenario 2: User correctly guesses tails
Details:
  TestName: test_user_correctly_guesses_tails
  Description: Tests if the function appropriately handles the scenario where the user guesses tails correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "2" and `random.randint` to return 2.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1, indicating the user won.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can accurately handle correct guesses for tails, ensuring the fairness and correctness of the game logic.

### Scenario 3: User guesses heads but the toss is tails
Details:
  TestName: test_user_guesses_heads_result_tails
  Description: Ensures the function properly handles cases where the user's guess is incorrect.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "1" and `random.randint` to return 2.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2, indicating the other player won.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's ability to accurately process losses due to incorrect guesses, which is crucial for maintaining game integrity and user trust.

### Scenario 4: User guesses tails but the toss is heads
Details:
  TestName: test_user_guesses_tails_result_heads
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies when the user guesses tails but the toss results in heads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "2" and `random.randint` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2, indicating the other player won.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle incorrect guesses and ensure the correct determination of the game result, critical for game fairness.

### Scenario 5: User inputs an invalid choice
Details:
  TestName: test_user_inputs_invalid_choice
  Description: Tests the function's response to an invalid input, such as a number outside the expected range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "3" (an invalid choice).
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Ideally, the test would check for some form of error handling or reprompting, but as the current implementation may not support this, it would be an observation.
Validation:
  This test highlights the need for robust input validation to prevent game errors and ensure user inputs are within acceptable parameters, which is fundamental for game reliability.

### Note:
The current implementation of `toss` lacks error handling for invalid inputs and is not ideally structured for unit testing due to its heavy reliance on I/O operations. Consider refactoring to separate concerns and allow better testing and error handling.
