### Scenario 1: User Chooses Heads and Wins
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_heads_and_wins
  Description: This test verifies that when the user selects "heads" (1) and the random toss also results in "heads" (1), the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return "1" and the random.randint function to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: The function should return 1, indicating that the user has won the toss.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the toss function correctly interprets both the user's input and the random result, awarding the win to the user when both match. This aligns with the game's rules where the user wins if their guess matches the toss result.

### Scenario 2: User Chooses Tails and Loses
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_tails_and_loses
  Description: This test checks that when the user selects "tails" (2) and the random toss results in "heads" (1), the function correctly identifies that the user has lost.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return "2" and the random.randint function to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: The function should return 2, indicating that player 2 (not the user) wins the toss.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle a mismatch between the user's choice and the random toss result, ensuring the correct interpretation and outcome as per the game's rules.

### Scenario 3: User Input Is Invalid
Details:
  TestName: test_user_input_is_invalid
  Description: This test ensures that the function toss handles non-integer and out-of-bound inputs gracefully, either by re-prompting the user or handling it as an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return a non-integer or out-of-bound value and observe the function's behavior.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: The function should not crash and should handle the input appropriately, possibly by raising an error or re-prompting for input.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure robustness in the face of invalid input, maintaining the integrity and the playability of the game even when unexpected inputs are provided.

### Scenario 4: Randomness of Toss Outcome
Details:
  TestName: test_randomness_of_toss_outcome
  Description: This test confirms that the function produces an evenly distributed random outcome over multiple invocations, reflecting a fair game condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call the toss function a significant number of times (e.g., 1000 times) and record the outcomes.
  Act: Analyze the distribution of the results to see if they approximate a 50/50 distribution between 1 and 2.
  Assert: The distribution should not significantly deviate from 50/50, confirming the randomness.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the random outcomes are evenly distributed is crucial for the fairness of the game, aligning with the expected behavior of a truly random and unbiased coin toss.

### Scenario 5: Consistent Output Message with Toss Result
Details:
  TestName: test_output_message_matches_toss_result
  Description: This test ensures that the output message ("Heads!" or "Tails!") matches the actual result of the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to choose a specific outcome and mock random.randint to return the same outcome.
  Act: Capture the output of the function and compare it with the expected message.
  Assert: The printed message should correctly describe the toss outcome.
Validation:
  This test verifies the user interface aspect of the function, ensuring that the messages displayed to the user are consistent with the game outcomes, thereby maintaining transparency and trust in the game mechanics.
