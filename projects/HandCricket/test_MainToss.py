Scenario 1: Correct user choice with heads
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_user_choice_heads
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies when the user's choice matches the toss result when it is heads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to be '1' and the random.randint function to always return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly identifies when the user has won the toss by choosing heads.

Scenario 2: Correct user choice with tails
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_user_choice_tails
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies when the user's choice matches the toss result when it is tails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to be '2' and the random.randint function to always return 2.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly identifies when the user has won the toss by choosing tails.

Scenario 3: Incorrect user choice with heads
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_user_choice_heads
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies when the user's choice does not match the toss result when it is heads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to be '2' and the random.randint function to always return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly identifies when the user has lost the toss by choosing tails when the result is heads.

Scenario 4: Incorrect user choice with tails
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_user_choice_tails
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly identifies when the user's choice does not match the toss result when it is tails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the user's input to be '1' and the random.randint function to always return 2.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly identifies when the user has lost the toss by choosing heads when the result is tails.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
  Correctness: The correctness of the function can be tested by mocking the user's input and the random.randint function to control the toss result. By doing this, we can verify that the function correctly identifies the winner of the toss.
  Boundary Conditions: The boundary conditions for this function are well defined, as the user's input and the toss result can only be 1 or 2. These conditions are covered in the above scenarios.
  Error Handling: This function does not have any error handling as it assumes the user's input will always be either '1' or '2'. A potential test could be added to verify the function's behavior when an invalid input is given. However, this was ruled out as per the problem statement.
  Performance: The performance of this function is not a concern as it does not handle large data sets or perform any complex operations.
  Security: This function does not have any security concerns as it does not handle any sensitive data or perform any operations that could potentially breach data integrity or security.
