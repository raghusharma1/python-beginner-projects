### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a well-known leap year, such as 2020.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. It validates the correct application of leap year rules (years divisible by 4).

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a common non-leap year, such as 2019.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can accurately identify non-leap years, which is crucial for its accuracy and reliability in various applications relying on date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 1900, which is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the refined leap year rule, which states that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This scenario is essential for ensuring accuracy over long time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 2000, which is divisible by both 100 and 400.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly apply the complete set of leap year rules, including the special rule for century years, which is critical for accurate calendar-related calculations and data processing.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year
  Description: Verify whether the function correctly identifies if the current year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it programmatically.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct boolean value based on whether the current year is a leap year or not.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's relevance and accuracy in real-time applications by dynamically determining the nature of the current year, which is important for applications that need to adjust behavior based on the current date.

These scenarios cover typical use cases, edge cases, and dynamic real-time checking, ensuring comprehensive testing of the `judge_leap_year` function's logic and its adherence to leap year rules.
