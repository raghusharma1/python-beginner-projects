### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which state that a year divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400 is a leap year. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify standard non-leap years, essential for any date-handling logic in business applications that depend on accurate year classifications.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_non_leap_century
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function properly implements the leap year exception for most century years (those not divisible by 400). This is crucial for correct date processing over a range of historical or future dates.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_leap_century
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a leap century year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function respects the full rules of the Gregorian calendar by recognizing that century years divisible by 400 are indeed leap years. This is critical for accurate calendaring and scheduling tasks that span multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_year
  Description: Verifies the function's accuracy with a year far in the future (e.g., 2400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's reliability for future date calculations, ensuring long-term usability of the software for calendaring and future event planning.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_current_year
  Description: Assesses the function's response to being called with the current year, dynamically determined at runtime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using `time.localtime().tm_year`.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return `True` or `False` based on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  This dynamic test ensures the function's real-time applicability, making it relevant for applications that need to adjust behavior based on the current date.
