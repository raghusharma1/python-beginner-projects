### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass a known leap year (e.g., 2020) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule for leap years, ensuring accuracy in calculations relying on correct year type identification.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year (e.g., 2019) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly identifies standard years, which is crucial for applications that depend on accurate date handling, such as scheduling and annual financial calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900. According to the Gregorian calendar, a century year is not a leap year unless it is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the more complex rule of the Gregorian calendar regarding century years, which is essential for accurate historical data processing and long-term planning tools.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000. Century years are leap years only if they are divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately recognizes the special case of century leap years, critical for software that deals with a range of historical to future date calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a future leap year, demonstrating its capability to handle dates beyond the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass a future leap year (e.g., 2044) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's reliability for future date predictions, which is necessary for planning and forecasting applications in various fields like astronomy and finance.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before the Gregorian calendar implementation)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Checks if the function can handle years before the Gregorian calendar's implementation, such as -100 (100 BC).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass the year -100 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False or True based on the leap year rules applied retrospectively.
Validation:
  This test explores the function's behavior with unconventional input, assessing its robustness and accuracy in handling historical date calculations that might be relevant for academic and scientific purposes.
