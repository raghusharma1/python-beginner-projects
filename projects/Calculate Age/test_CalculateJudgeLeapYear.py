### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are any year divisible by 4, except for years divisible by 100 but not by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with a known leap year such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to recognize standard leap years, which is fundamental to its purpose. Ensuring it handles typical cases correctly aligns with the business logic of managing date-related calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with a non-leap year such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  It is crucial for the function to distinguish between leap and non-leap years accurately to avoid errors in date calculations that depend on this differentiation. This scenario validates that basic functionality.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test examines the function's ability to correctly identify a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years that are not divisible by 400 are not leap years, even though they are divisible by 100. This test ensures that the function adheres to this more complex rule, which is vital for accurate calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This scenario tests the function's ability to identify a century year that is a leap year, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Confirming that the function can handle the special rule for century leap years (divisible by 400) is essential for maintaining its reliability in all scenarios involving leap year calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response when provided with the current year, ensuring it remains relevant with time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year using `time.localtime().tm_year`.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False depending on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures the function's ongoing applicability and helps verify its real-time accuracy without needing future adjustments for time-based validation.
