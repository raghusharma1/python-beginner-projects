### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years. This is a fundamental requirement for the function to meet the expected behavior for leap year calculation.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify common non-leap years, which is critical for any application dependent on accurate date-time calculations, such as scheduling and calendaring systems.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, such as 1900, to ensure it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks compliance with the rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This is crucial for correct date handling around century transitions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_four_hundred_multiple_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a leap year that is a multiple of 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests a special rule of the Gregorian calendar that affects computation of very infrequent but significant leap years, ensuring the function's accuracy over long time spans.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly evaluates the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it programmatically via `time.localtime().tm_year`.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Manually verify if the current year is a leap year and check the function's return against this.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is relevant and functions correctly with contemporary data, which is essential for applications relying on current date-time data.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_year
  Description: Validate the function's prediction for a future year's leap year status, such as the year 2104.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2104.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function can correctly predict leap years in the future, which is important for planning and forecasting applications extending into future dates.

### Scenario 7: Test with a very distant past year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_distant_past_year
  Description: Checks the function's behavior for a year far in the past, such as the year 800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 800.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's robustness and accuracy when dealing with historical data, which can be crucial for historical research and applications requiring long-term data analysis.
