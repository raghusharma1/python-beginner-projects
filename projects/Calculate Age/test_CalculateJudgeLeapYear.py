### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to recognize standard non-leap years, which is essential for any date-related operations, ensuring accuracy in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, like 1900, to ensure it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario checks compliance with the rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. It's important for maintaining accurate calendar calculations over longer time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a leap year when the year is a multiple of 400, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to recognize the exception to the century rule in the leap year calculation, ensuring accuracy in exceptional calendar scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly identify a future leap year, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains reliable for future calculations, which is vital for planning and scheduling applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirms that the function can correctly identify a future non-leap year, such as 2049.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2049.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function's ongoing reliability in identifying non-leap years in the future, which is critical for any future-oriented date computations.
