### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to recognize a common leap year, ensuring that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is correctly implemented. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Itâ€™s essential to confirm that the function correctly identifies typical non-leap years to prevent errors in date handling and calculations, which can affect chronological data processing and validations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the refined leap year rule involving century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This scenario is crucial for ensuring accuracy over long time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000) because it is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's compliance with the complete leap year rule, including the exception for century years divisible by 400. This is vital for accurate date and time processing in software dealing with extensive historical or future date ranges.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_far_future_year
  Description: Test the function with a year far in the future to ensure it still applies leap year rules correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year ensures the function remains reliable for future date calculations, essential for applications involving long-term planning or simulations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_distant_past_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year far in the past to confirm historical accuracy.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1600.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's reliability in handling dates from significant historical periods, crucial for applications in history, archaeology, or any field requiring accurate historical date analysis.
