### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400. The year 2020 meets the first condition but not the exceptions, hence it is correctly identified as a leap year. This test ensures the function can identify standard leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  The year 2019 is not divisible by 4, making it a non-leap year. This test confirms that the function accurately identifies typical non-leap years, which is crucial for correct year categorization.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, such as 1900, to ensure it is identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Though 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400. The function must correctly apply this rule to identify it as a non-leap year. This test checks the function's ability to handle exceptions in leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function identifies years divisible by 400 as leap years, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is an exception to the century rule because it is divisible by 400. Testing this ensures the function correctly handles all nuances of leap year calculation.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy with a future leap year, ensuring its continual correctness.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2400, while far in the future, is still divisible by 4 and 400, making it a leap year. This scenario tests the functionâ€™s capability to handle years well beyond the current date, confirming its long-term reliability in leap year determination.

### Scenario 6: Test with negative year (BC)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Evaluates the function's behavior with a year before 1 AD, which could be relevant in historical contexts or specific calendrical calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with -400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Negative years (BC) can also be leap years if they satisfy the same divisibility rules. Testing with -400 checks if the function correctly applies leap year rules irrespective of the era, ensuring its applicability in broader historical or scientific contexts.
