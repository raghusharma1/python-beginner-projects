### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures the function can accurately identify a clear-cut case of a leap year, which is fundamental to its purpose.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year. Non-leap years are those not divisible by 4.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the function's ability to correctly reject a common non-leap year, confirming its basic operational accuracy.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900). Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Testing with century years that are exceptions in the leap year rule is essential to ensure the function adheres to the nuanced Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000). Century years are leap years only if divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test is critical for confirming that the function can correctly handle the special rule involving century years, which is a less common but important scenario.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year at the boundary of leap year definition
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior with a year right at the boundary of the leap year definition, such as the year 4, the first leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 4.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing boundary conditions like the very first leap year ensures the function's robustness and adherence to the full range of valid leap years.
