### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately identifies years that do not meet the leap year criteria, which is crucial for accurate date management in applications.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's adherence to the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This confirms the function's compliance with more complex leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly implements the exception to the typical century rule, which is crucial for accurate calendrical calculations every 400 years.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly assess the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using `time.localtime().tm_year`.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return `True` or `False` based on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamically obtained years (like the current year) ensures that the function is reliable under different time conditions and remains relevant for real-time applications.

### Scenario 6: Test the lower boundary of valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_lower_boundary_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response when provided with the year 1, which is the lowest technically valid input for a year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: The function should return `False` as 1 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  It's important to verify that the function handles the extreme lower boundary of valid inputs correctly, ensuring robustness and accuracy in historical or extensive date range applications.
