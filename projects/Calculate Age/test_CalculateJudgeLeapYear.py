### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The correctness of the function for typical leap years ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly identify non-leap years, ensuring it does not falsely classify common years as leap years. Accurate detection of non-leap years is crucial for any applications dependent on precise date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900, even though it is divisible by 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test is crucial to ensure the function's compliance with this additional rule, which is a refinement of the leap year calculation in the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century and divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_century_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year correctly when the year is a century and divisible by 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly handles the special case of centuries that are leap years, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy over long time spans and adhering to the full rules of the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Checks the function's response when given the current year, ensuring it handles dynamically changing input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year as the input by retrieving it via the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct leap year status for the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures the function's relevance and accuracy in real-time applications. This scenario is crucial for systems requiring up-to-date validations, such as scheduling or planning applications that operate in the present.

These scenarios cover a variety of typical and edge cases, ensuring that the function behaves correctly under different conditions and adheres to the rules governing leap years in the Gregorian calendar.
