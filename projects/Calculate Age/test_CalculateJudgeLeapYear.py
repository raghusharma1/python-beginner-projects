### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400. The year 2020 meets the first condition, making it a leap year. This test ensures the function adheres to this part of the leap year rule.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  The year 2019 is not divisible by 4, making it a standard year. This test confirms that the function correctly identifies standard years, which is crucial for any application relying on accurate year classification.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function identifies a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  According to leap year rules, even though 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400. This test ensures the function correctly applies this more complex rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Verifies that the function recognizes a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is divisible by 400, making it a leap year despite being a century. This test checks the function's ability to handle the special rule concerning century years, which is essential for correct date management in longitudinal studies or historical data analysis.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years that are far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year like 2400 (which is a leap year) ensures the function remains accurate over time and does not suffer from integer overflow or other time-related errors. This is vital for applications that need to handle dates far in the future, such as planning software or futuristic simulations.
