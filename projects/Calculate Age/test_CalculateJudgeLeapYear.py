### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Testing with non-leap years verifies that the function properly handles the more frequent scenario where a year is not a leap year, confirming the function's reliability and accuracy.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) which is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are a special case in leap year calculation. This test ensures that the function adheres to the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000), which is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's ability to correctly identify the less frequent case of a leap century year, which is essential for maintaining accurate date and time calculations across centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's correctness for a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2400).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function is future-proof is crucial for applications that may need to work with dates far in the future. This test ensures that the leap year calculation remains robust regardless of the year evaluated.

### Scenario 6: Test with the earliest year technically supported
Details:
  TestName: test_early_year
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1, which is technically the earliest year representable.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1).
  Assert: The function should return False since year 1 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to handle boundary conditions at the start of the Gregorian calendar, ensuring its robustness and accuracy in all supported ranges.
