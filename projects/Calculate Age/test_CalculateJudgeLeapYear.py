### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years divisible by 4.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year. Most years are non-leap years, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function accurately identifies common years as non-leap years, adhering to the standard calendar rules.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900. According to the Gregorian calendar, century years are only leap years if divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the specific exception in leap year rules concerning century years, which is critical for correct calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000. Century years that are divisible by 400 are leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's compliance with the full leap year rule, including the special rule for century years divisible by 400, which is essential for accurate date handling.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly identify future leap years, such as 2400. This helps validate the function's long-term utility.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2400).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates is vital to ensure the function remains reliable in future implementations and continues to adhere to established leap year rules.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to handle years far in the past, such as 800, which is also a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(800).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness and accuracy across a wide range of years, ensuring it is not limited to contemporary or near-contemporary dates.

These scenarios cover a comprehensive range of typical and edge cases that help ensure the `judge_leap_year` function performs accurately and consistently across diverse conditions, adhering to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
