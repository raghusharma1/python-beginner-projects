### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly reject common non-leap years, which is essential for any date-related functionality, ensuring accuracy in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test confirms the function's compliance with this refined rule, which is critical for maintaining calendar accuracy over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the special rule that century years divisible by 400 are leap years. This is crucial for applications that depend on precise date handling across centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Confirms that the function can accurately determine leap years in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates is essential to ensure that the function will remain reliable as time progresses, especially for software that plans far into the future.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's ability to identify non-leap years in the future, such as 2401.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2401.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the leap year calculation remains accurate going into the future, which is vital for any long-term calendrical calculations or planning.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the judge_leap_year function behaves correctly across typical, atypical, past, present, and future years, maintaining accuracy in identifying leap years as defined by the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
