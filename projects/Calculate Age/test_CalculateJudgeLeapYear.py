### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, such as 2020 or 2024.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2024)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that any year divisible by 4 is a leap year, assuming it is not a century year unless divisible by 400. Thus, confirming it handles straightforward leap year calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, such as 2021.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2021)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function can distinguish common years from leap years, which is fundamental to its purpose, ensuring correct functionality across the majority of years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the leap year rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This ensures the function can handle exceptions to the general leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is also a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical for confirming that the function accurately implements the full leap year rule, including the special case for years that are divisible by 400. It ensures the function's reliability for all types of years in the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Validates the function's response when provided with the current year, dynamically determining if it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `time.localtime().tm_year` to get the current year.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(time.localtime().tm_year)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches `isleap(time.localtime().tm_year)`.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures the function's real-time applicability and correctness, ensuring it functions correctly within the context of its current usage. This dynamic approach tests the function's adaptability and accuracy in real-world scenarios.
