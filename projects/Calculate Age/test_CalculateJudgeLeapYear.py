### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, which is a fundamental rule for leap years. Ensuring this works confirms the function's utility for typical leap year scenarios.

### Scenario 2: Test for a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly identify years that are not leap years, which is critical for accurate date management in applications that depend on precise date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, such as 1900, to ensure it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial because it tests the special rule that century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This is a more nuanced aspect of leap year calculation, and its correct implementation is vital for accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test for a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a multiple of 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is critical because it checks the exception to the century rule, where multiples of 400 are leap years. This ensures the function can handle all nuances involved in leap year determination.

### Scenario 5: Test for a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Assesses the function's ability to determine leap years well into the future, such as the year 2400, ensuring the function's long-term reliability.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Testing with a future year is important to ensure that the leap year calculation logic remains valid regardless of the year, accommodating software that may need to operate or predict long-term schedules or calendars.

### Scenario 6: Test for the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Checks whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year, ensuring dynamic date handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The expected result depends on whether the current year is a leap year or not; assert accordingly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is responsive to real-time data, which is critical for applications that rely on current date information for processing or decision-making. This test ensures the function's relevance and correctness in a live environment.
