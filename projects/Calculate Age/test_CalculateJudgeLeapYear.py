### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years; thus, 2020 is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2020)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify standard leap years, which is crucial for date-related calculations in various applications.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year. For example, 2019 is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2019)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the functionâ€™s ability to correctly reject non-leap years, which is essential for maintaining accuracy in date-handling functionalities.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  It is important to verify this because not all century years are leap years; they must be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year. This test confirms the function adheres to this rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function recognizes a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the special rule for century years, where only those divisible by 400 are leap years. This is vital for correct date processing in long-term calendrical calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function can correctly identify a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2400)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains reliable in futuristic scenarios, crucial for applications involving long-term planning or date predictions.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a future non-leap year, such as 2401.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2401)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's reliability in future scenarios where accurate date differentiation is required, supporting applications that depend on precise date calculations.
