### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years; thus, 2020 is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2020)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule for typical leap years, which is crucial for any date-related computations relying on accurate year length.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2019)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly applies leap year rules, ensuring accurate identification of common years, which is essential for correct date handling in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year by Gregorian rules, as it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical to ensure that the function correctly implements the full leap year rule, including the exception for most century years, which is vital for accurate calendar and scheduling applications.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a year divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000) as a leap year, in accordance with Gregorian rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is `True`.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly handles the special case of century years that are leap years, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy in date-related functionalities over long time spans.

### Scenario 5: Test with a negative year
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Tests the function's behavior when provided with a negative year, which is technically valid in historical dating (e.g., -100).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(-100)`.
  Assert: Verify whether the function returns the correct leap year status for the given year.
Validation:
  Important for historical data calculations and applications that might need to handle dates in a broader historical context. Ensures the function is robust and versatile across a wide range of input values.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly evaluates the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(current_year)`, where `current_year` is dynamically determined at runtime.
  Assert: Verify the result based on the current year's leap status.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function remains relevant and accurate for real-time and current date evaluations, supporting applications that depend on current date information.
