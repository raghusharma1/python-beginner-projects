### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function adheres to the basic leap year rule, which is the primary functionality of the `judge_leap_year` function. A leap year is divisible by 4 and returns True, confirming the function's accuracy for straightforward cases.

### Scenario 2: Test with a common non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_common_non_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  It's crucial to ensure that the function can accurately identify typical non-leap years. This test checks if the function correctly returns False for years that are not divisible by 4, ensuring it properly handles the most frequent scenario where the year is not a leap year.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's compliance with the rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. Testing with 1900, which is not divisible by 400, should return False, validating that the function handles exceptions to the every four-year rule correctly.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies century years that are leap years, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to recognize that years divisible by 400 are leap years, even if they are century years. This test confirms the function's capability to handle special conditions correctly, ensuring comprehensive coverage of leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's correctness with a future leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Testing with future leap years ensures that the function remains valid for future calculations. This is crucial for applications relying on this function for long-term planning or scheduling, confirming the function's reliability over time.

Each of these scenarios is crafted to ensure that `judge_leap_year` behaves as expected under various conditions defined by the rules governing leap years. These tests collectively ensure that the function is robust, reliable, and adheres to defined specifications.
