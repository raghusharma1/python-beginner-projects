### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function can correctly identify such years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function can accurately distinguish between leap years and common years, ensuring reliability in its ability to handle typical non-leap year scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario is important because, according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar, a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 is not a leap year. This test checks the function's adherence to this rule, which is critical for its accuracy in edge cases.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's capability to recognize the special case of century years that are also leap years (divisible by 400). This is essential for complete compliance with the Gregorian calendar's rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a future leap year, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains relevant and accurate in future contexts, maintaining its utility in long-term applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_ancient_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy for a year far in the past, such as 800, which is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 800.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  It's important to confirm that the function accurately handles dates from a very distant past, ensuring the function's robustness and its ability to handle a wide range of input years effectively.
