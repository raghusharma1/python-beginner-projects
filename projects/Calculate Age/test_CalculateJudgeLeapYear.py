### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that any year divisible by 4 is a leap year unless it is a century not divisible by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to correctly identify a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately identifies standard years that do not meet the conditions of a leap year, a fundamental requirement for correct date management in many applications.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a century and not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical because it checks the special rule of the Gregorian calendar that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. It verifies the function's accuracy in handling exceptional calendar rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function can identify a leap year that is also a century year, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with the year 2000 confirms the function's compliance with the Gregorian rule that century years divisible by 400 are leap years. This test is essential for validating the function's correctness in special cases.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Confirms that the function can correctly evaluate leap years in the future, such as 2048.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2048.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  It is crucial to ensure that the function performs accurately not only for past and present years but also for future dates. This test checks the function's reliability and consistency in handling dates beyond the current year.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Tests the function's behavior with a negative year (representing years BC), such as -400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with -400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Though less common in typical applications, ensuring the function can handle negative years is vital for historical data processing or applications requiring such calculations. This test checks the function's versatility and thoroughness in handling a broader range of input values.
