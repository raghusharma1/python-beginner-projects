### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are those divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a year known to be a leap year, such as 2020.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2020)`.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a year that is not a leap year, such as 2019.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2019)`.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to correctly identify common non-leap years, ensuring reliability in normal conditions.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, e.g., 1900. Century years are only leap years if divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 1900 for this test.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `False`.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly implements the special rule for century years, which is essential for accurate calendrical computations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes a century year that is a leap year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 2000, a known leap year.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's adherence to the complete leap year rule, including exceptions for certain century years. It's critical for ensuring accuracy in date-related operations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly determine leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose the year 2400, which is a leap year.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2400)`.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future years ensures that the function remains reliable for future date calculations, which is essential for long-term planning and scheduling in various applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy for years in the distant past, using the year 1800, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select the year 1800.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1800)`.
  Assert: The result should be `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly handles dates from historical contexts, which may be necessary for historical data analysis and back-testing in various fields.

Each of these scenarios is designed to validate critical aspects of the leap year calculation, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both typical and edge cases in the function `judge_leap_year`.
