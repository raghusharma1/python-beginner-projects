### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function can correctly identify such years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function can accurately distinguish between leap years and common years, ensuring reliability in its ability to handle typical non-leap year scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. Test with the year 1900, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's adherence to the extended rule of the Gregorian calendar concerning century years. It's important to ensure that the function does not incorrectly classify all century years as leap years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year like 2000, which is a century year but also a leap year because it's divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly applies the leap year rule to century years divisible by 400. It's vital for maintaining accuracy in calculating dates that depend on precise year categorization.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate future leap years, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains robust and reliable for future calculations, an essential factor for long-term applications relying on date computations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_ancient_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to handle years far in the past, such as 800, which is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 800.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's consistency over a wide range of years, ensuring its utility for historical date calculations and academic applications.
