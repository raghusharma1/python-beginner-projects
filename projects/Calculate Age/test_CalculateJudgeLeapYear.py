### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which are crucial for calendar-related computations in various applications.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Verifying non-leap years is as important as validating leap years to maintain the accuracy of date-related functionalities in software systems.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test ensures the function's compliance with this rule, which is critical for correct calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function identifies a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing leap year calculation for century years divisible by 400 ensures the function's accuracy in special cases, which is essential for any system relying on precise date management.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to handle and correctly determine leap years far in the future (e.g., 2400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's reliability for future dates is crucial for long-term planning and scheduling applications, affirming its robustness and forward-compatibility.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies non-leap years far in the past (e.g., 1800).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1800.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's effectiveness across a wide range of historical dates, ensuring its utility in historical data analysis and other retrospective applications.
