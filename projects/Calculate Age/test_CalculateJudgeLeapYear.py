### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2020, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is implemented correctly. Ensuring the function recognizes typical leap years is fundamental to its purpose.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year, such as 2019, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the function does not incorrectly identify common years as leap years. Accurate differentiation between leap and non-leap years is crucial for the function's reliability.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the refined rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This is a crucial aspect of leap year calculation, preventing inaccurate date calculations over longer time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly implements the exception to the century rule, identifying years divisible by 400 as leap years. It is critical for ensuring accurate calculations around century transitions.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly identify a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2400 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains reliable for future calculations. It's important for applications requiring long-term date calculations, ensuring the function's utility remains consistent regardless of the year queried.
