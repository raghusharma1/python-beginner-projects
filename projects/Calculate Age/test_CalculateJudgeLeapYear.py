### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400. This scenario confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules regarding leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function accurately identifies typical years that are not leap years, supporting its reliability in distinguishing between leap and non-leap years based on the standard rules.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a century (e.g., 1900) and not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Important for verifying the function's compliance with the exception in leap year rules, where most century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This ensures the function's accuracy over a broader range of years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year that falls on a century, like the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the exception to the century rule, confirming that the function accurately identifies centuries that are also leap years (divisible by 400). It is critical for ensuring the function's reliability and adherence to the full leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with the current year, determining if it is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Manually check if the current year is a leap year and assert accordingly.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is relevant and functioning correctly in the present context. It helps in validating real-time applicability of the function for current year assessments, which might be useful in applications requiring current date context awareness.

### Scenario 6: Test with the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Validates the function's behavior when passed the year zero, which technically should be treated as a leap year since it is divisible by 4.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's adherence to leap year rules even at the edge case of year zero. It's important for historical or theoretical applications where such a year might need to be evaluated.
