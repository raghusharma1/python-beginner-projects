### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, which is critical for its accuracy and reliability in scheduling and calendar-related calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900, to ensure it correctly identifies exceptions to the typical every-four-year rule.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test confirms the function adheres to this nuanced rule, which is essential for its accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies century years that are leap years, such as the year 2000, correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the complete leap year rule, including the special rule for century years, ensuring its utility in real-world applications over long time periods.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies leap years in the future, such as 2044, ensuring its continued relevance.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2044).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function will continue to be accurate as time progresses, supporting planning and forecasting applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Verifies the function's accuracy for years far in the past, such as 1600, to check its historical applicability.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1600).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy is maintained across a broad range of historical years, which is important for historical data analysis and educational applications.

Each test scenario is crafted to validate a specific aspect of the leap year determination logic, ensuring comprehensive coverage and reliability of the function `judge_leap_year`.
