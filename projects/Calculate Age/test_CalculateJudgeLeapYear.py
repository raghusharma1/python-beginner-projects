### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, which is critical for its accuracy and reliability in scheduling and calendar-related calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900, to ensure it correctly identifies such exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Important for verifying the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar rule that only centuries divisible by 400 are leap years. This ensures accuracy across a broad range of years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Checks if the function identifies a year that is a multiple of 400 as a leap year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the function adheres to the leap year rule for century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be considered leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly determine leap years in the future, such as the year 2080.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2080).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Validates that the function is future-proof and can handle leap year calculations for years well beyond the current date, which is essential for long-term planning and scheduling applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with the earliest year supported by the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_year_1582
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1582, the first year the Gregorian calendar was adopted, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1582).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case of the very first year of the Gregorian calendar's implementation, which is crucial for historical data accuracy.
