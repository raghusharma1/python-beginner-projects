### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing this test is crucial as it checks the primary functionality of the method to correctly identify leap years, which are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400. Confirming this behavior ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is essential for verifying that the function accurately identifies typical non-leap years. Non-leap years are those not divisible by 4. This ensures the function's accuracy in normal conditions.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Testing century years is critical as these are exceptions in the leap year rule; a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. This test ensures the function adheres to these nuanced rules of the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes years divisible by 400 as leap years, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it checks the function's compliance with the special rule that years divisible by 400 are leap years, even though they are century years. This verifies that the function correctly implements all aspects of the leap year determination.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with a future leap year input, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness and forward compatibility of the function by using a year well beyond typical testing ranges. It ensures the function remains accurate for future dates, maintaining its utility in long-term applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's correct behavior when evaluating a distant past leap year, such as the year 1600.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1600.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can accurately evaluate years from historical periods, confirming its effectiveness across a broad temporal range. This is important for applications that might deal with historical data.
