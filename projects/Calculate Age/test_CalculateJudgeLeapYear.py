### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary requirement. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Confirm that the function reliably recognizes non-leap years. Non-leap years are not divisible by 4, which is essential for maintaining accurate yearly calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Confirm that the function adheres to the rule that century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400, which is crucial for correct date management over longer periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle the special rule for century years that are divisible by 400 and thus are leap years. This is critical for accurate leap year calculations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a leap year far in the future, ensuring the function's reliability over time.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2400.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's long-term accuracy and reliability in identifying leap years, which is essential for future-proofing applications that depend on date calculations.
