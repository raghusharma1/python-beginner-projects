### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for leap years divisible by 4 but not by 100. This is a basic requirement for leap year calculation and is essential for validating the correctness of the function.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a year not divisible by 4, such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Testing with non-leap years confirms that the function can correctly identify years that do not meet the leap year criteria. This is crucial for the functionâ€™s utility and reliability in practical applications.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a year like 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Century years that are not divisible by 400 are not leap years. This scenario confirms that the function adheres to this more nuanced part of the leap year rule, which is critical for its accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies century years that are leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a year like 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly applies the exception to the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400. It is essential for ensuring the function's compliance with the complete set of leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test the lower boundary of year input
Details:
  TestName: test_lower_boundary_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response when given the lowest typically valid year input, 1 AD.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  It's important to assess boundary conditions to ensure the function's robustness. Testing the function with the year 1 ensures it can handle and correctly evaluate edge cases at the start of the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function can correctly identify a future leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a future year like 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains relevant and accurate for future calculations, which is critical for applications that need to manage future events or planning.
