### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for standard leap years, which are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless also divisible by 400. This aligns with the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  It validates the function's ability to correctly reject a common year that does not meet the criteria for a leap year, ensuring its reliability in general use.

### Scenario 3: Test a leap year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: This test ensures that the function identifies leap years that are divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function adheres to the leap year rule for century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy over long time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test a century year not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_not_a_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years because they are not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly applies the exception to the general leap year rule for century years, critical for accurate date handling in software that spans multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the earliest year in the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_earliest_gregorian_year
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with the year 1582, the first year of the Gregorian calendar adoption.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1582.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's reliability at the boundary of the Gregorian calendar's introduction, which is essential for historical data processing or software dealing with historical dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function can correctly identify a leap year in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a future leap year, such as 2080.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with a future date ensures that the function remains accurate for future date calculations, important for planning and scheduling applications.

### Scenario 7: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function can correctly identify a non-leap year in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a future non-leap year, such as 2101.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function accurately identifies non-leap years in the future, maintaining its utility in long-term applications and systems.
