### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2024`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that leap years are every four years, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but not by 400. The year 2024 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, hence it should be identified as a leap year.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2023`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2023 is not divisible by 4, so it should correctly be identified as a non-leap year, which is crucial for accurate date management in applications.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validate that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `1900`.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that while 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400, making it not a leap year. This test ensures the function adheres to the special rule concerning century years.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `2000`.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2000 is divisible by both 100 and 400, qualifying it as a leap year. This test confirms the function's compliance with the leap year rule for century years.

### Scenario 5: Test the minimum boundary year for leap year evaluation
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_boundary_year
  Description: Test the function with the lowest year typically used in Gregorian calendar calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `1`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of accurately evaluating leap years from the beginning of the Gregorian calendar to ensure date calculations are correct from historical perspectives.

### Scenario 6: Test a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validate that the function correctly identifies a future leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `2400`.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that testing with future dates ensures the function's continued relevance and accuracy in future applications, affirming its utility in long-term planning and scheduling systems.
