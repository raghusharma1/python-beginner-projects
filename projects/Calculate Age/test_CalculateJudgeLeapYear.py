### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400. The year 2020 meets the first condition but not the exceptions, hence it is a leap year. This test ensures the function adheres to these rules.

### Scenario 2: Test for a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a common non-leap year correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  The year 2019 is not divisible by 4, making it a standard non-leap year. This test validates the function's ability to correctly identify most common years.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests a century year that does not qualify as a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. Since 1900 is not, it should not be considered a leap year. This test confirms the function's compliance with this exception in leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test for a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Checks the functionâ€™s ability to identify a leap year when the year is a divisible-by-400 century, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is a century year and divisible by 400, making it a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly handles the special rule for century leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test for the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verifies the function's response on the current year, which varies depending on when the test is run.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using time.localtime().
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False based on the current year's leap year status.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year checks the function's real-time applicability and correctness. This scenario ensures the function's behavior aligns with ongoing chronological changes.

### Scenario 6: Test for a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function can accurately predict leap years in the future, such as 2040.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2040.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing future dates ensures that the function remains accurate over time, supporting long-term planning and computations that depend on correct leap year identification.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases that help ensure the robustness and accuracy of the `judge_leap_year` function in identifying leap years under various conditions.
