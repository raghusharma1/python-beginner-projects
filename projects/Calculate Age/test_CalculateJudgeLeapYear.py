### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with the parameter `year=2024`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years. Confirming that 2024, which is divisible by 4 but not by 100, is correctly evaluated affirms the function's capability to identify basic leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function properly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with the parameter `year=2023`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can accurately recognize years that do not meet the criteria for leap years. Since 2023 is not divisible by 4, it should not be a leap year, and the function should return `False`.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function accurately identifies a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with the parameter `year=1900`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it deals with an exception in the leap year rule: although 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400. The function must correctly handle such exceptions to comply with the full leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to recognize a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with the parameter `year=2000`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly applies the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400. Since 2000 meets these criteria, the function should return `True`, demonstrating proper handling of special leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly evaluate leap years in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with the parameter `year=2400`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with a future leap year like 2400 (which is a century leap year) ensures that the function remains accurate regardless of the year evaluated. This test is important for applications requiring long-term calendar calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a minimum valid year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_year_one
  Description: Verifies that the function can handle the smallest typical year used in historical and future calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with the parameter `year=1`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases at the lower end of the year spectrum. Year 1 is not a leap year, and the function should accurately reflect this, demonstrating robustness in handling a wide range of years.
