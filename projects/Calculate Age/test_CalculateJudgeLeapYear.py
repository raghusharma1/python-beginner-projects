### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a year variable set to 2024, which is a known leap year.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with this year.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The test checks if the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule for leap years. Ensuring it returns True for 2024 validates that the function correctly identifies standard leap years, which is crucial for any date-related computations relying on this function.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a year variable set to 2019, which is a known non-leap year.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with this year.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly reject a common year as non-leap. It is essential for maintaining accurate year calculations, especially in applications requiring precise date management.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900) to ensure it adheres to the exception in leap year rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a year variable to 1900.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with this year.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial because it tests the function's compliance with the leap year rule exception regarding most century years. Validating this ensures the function can accurately handle special cases in the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_leap_century_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a leap year that is a multiple of 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a year variable to 2000.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with this year.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is important because years that are multiples of 400 are exceptions to the typical century rule and are still leap years. Ensuring accurate identification of such years is essential for correct date management in longitudinal studies and historical data analysis.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_current_year
  Description: Tests the function with the current year to ensure dynamic functionality.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year obtained from the time module.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the current year.
  Assert: Check if the return value matches the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures that the function remains relevant and accurate over time, adapting to year-to-year changes. This is vital for applications that depend on real-time date calculations.
