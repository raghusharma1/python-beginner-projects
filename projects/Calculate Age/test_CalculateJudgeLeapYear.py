### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately identifies years that do not meet the leap year criteria, which is crucial for accurate date management in applications.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's adherence to the additional rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This ensures the function's correctness over a broader range of dates.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Century years that are divisible by 400 are rare exceptions in the leap year rule, and testing this ensures that the function can handle these exceptions accurately.

### Scenario 5: Test the minimum boundary year for leap year calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_boundary_year
  Description: Verify that the function can handle the smallest integer value technically supported, focusing on the year 1, the start of the modern calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: The function should return `False` as 1 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing this boundary condition ensures the function's robustness and correctness from the very start of the Gregorian calendar, confirming its utility in historical contexts.

### Scenario 6: Test a year that is divisible by 4 but not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_4_not_a_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly handles years like 1800, which are divisible by 4 but not leap years due to the century rule.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1800.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms the application of both the divisibility by 4 and the century rule, crucial for maintaining the function's accuracy in all cases specified by the Gregorian calendar.
