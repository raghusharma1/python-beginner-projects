### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years, which is a fundamental aspect of date handling in many computing contexts.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly reject common years that do not meet leap year criteria, crucial for accurate date calculations and calendar functionalities.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test confirms the function's compliance with this more nuanced part of the leap year rule, important for historical data and long-term calendrical calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes leap years that are exactly divisible by 400, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is critical to verify the function's adherence to the complete set of leap year rules, particularly the exception for years divisible by 400, ensuring accuracy over extensive calendrical ranges.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's correct determination of leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with distant future years ensures that the function remains reliable in futuristic scenarios, which is vital for software dealing with long-term planning or historical projections.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy for historical years that are not leap years, such as 1800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1800.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's effectiveness when working with historical data, particularly for applications in historical research or genealogy, where accurate date handling is crucial.
