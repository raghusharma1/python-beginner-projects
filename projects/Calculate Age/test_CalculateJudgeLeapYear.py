### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness in typical scenarios that are widely recognized as leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, confirming its utility in distinguishing between leap and non-leap years efficiently.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to correctly evaluate a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900, which is a common exception in leap year rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the function adheres to the full leap year rule, including exceptions for most century years unless divisible by 400, thereby validating the function's compliance with complex calendar rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year at the turn of the century
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_at_century_turn
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a leap year at the turn of a century, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the complete leap year rule, including the special case where century years are leap years if divisible by 400. This confirms the function's robustness in handling special calendar scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly identify a future leap year, such as 2044, ensuring its ongoing utility.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2044).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function remains accurate over time, maintaining its relevance and reliability in various temporal contexts.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_far_past_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy with historical data by evaluating a year far in the past, such as 1600.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1600).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's consistent performance across a wide range of years, confirming its effectiveness and accuracy in historical contexts, thereby supporting its use in diverse applications requiring date evaluations.
