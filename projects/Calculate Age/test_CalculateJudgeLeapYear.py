### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, which is critical for its accuracy and reliability in scheduling and calendar-related calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year, despite being divisible by 100, because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Important to test because it validates the function's adherence to the full leap year rule, not just the simple every-four-years rule. This ensures accuracy in broader historical and future calendrical computations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function with a year like 2000, which is divisible by 400 and therefore a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly implements the leap year rule for years divisible by 400, confirming its precision in special cases defined by the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verifies whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it from the system clock.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False based on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-time data ensures the function remains relevant and functional in practical, real-world applications, adapting correctly as years change.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can accurately predict leap years in the future, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2044).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify leap years in the future, essential for long-term planning and scheduling applications.

### Scenario 7: Test with a far past non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_far_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy with historical non-leap years, like 1800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1800).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's correctness over historical data, ensuring its utility in applications requiring historical date analysis.
