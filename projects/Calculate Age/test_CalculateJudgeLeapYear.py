### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for leap years divisible by 4 but not by 100. This is a basic requirement for leap year calculation and is essential for the correctness of the function.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a year not divisible by 4, such as 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Testing non-leap years validates the function's ability to correctly reject years that do not meet the leap year criteria, ensuring accurate and reliable date-related calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Century years that are not divisible by 400 are not leap years, even though they are divisible by 100. This test ensures that the function adheres to this more refined rule in leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function recognizes century years that are divisible by 400 as leap years, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function properly applies the leap year rule extension for century years divisible by 400. It is crucial for maintaining accuracy in scenarios involving significant calendar computations.

### Scenario 5: Test the minimum valid input year
Details:
  TestName: test_min_valid_year
  Description: Test the function with the earliest year reasonably possible, such as the year 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: The function should return `False` since year 1 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the functionâ€™s behavior at the boundary of its input range, ensuring reliability even with uncommon or extreme values.

### Scenario 6: Test a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's capability to handle years far in the future, ensuring that the leap year calculation remains robust and future-proof.
