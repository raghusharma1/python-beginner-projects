### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function can correctly identify such years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function can accurately distinguish between leap years and common years, ensuring reliability in non-leap year scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the special rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This ensures the function's compliance with more complex leap year rules, which is vital for correct date handling across centuries.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the correct application of the leap year exception for century years divisible by 400. It is essential for validating the functionâ€™s adherence to the complete set of rules governing leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly evaluates a future year that is a leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future leap years ensures the function remains accurate over time, supporting long-term usability and reliability in applications requiring future date evaluations.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Determines whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year as input.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year obtained via time.localtime().tm_year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False based on the current year's leap year status.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's real-time relevance and accuracy, providing assurance that it functions correctly with present-day data.
