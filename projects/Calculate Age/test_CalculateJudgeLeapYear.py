### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The year 2024 is chosen as it is a standard example of a leap year, adhering to the rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years unless divisible by 100 and not by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to recognize standard non-leap years, which is crucial for its accuracy. The year 2023 is a typical example of a non-leap year, not meeting any criteria for leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Test the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, ensuring it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's adherence to the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. The year 1900 is a critical test case as it is often mistakenly considered a leap year.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify a century year that is also a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with the year 2000 verifies the function's capability to recognize the special rule for century years that are divisible by 400. This ensures the function's reliability across all types of leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Validates whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the `time` module to get the current year.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Check the return value against the `isleap` function directly for the current year.
Validation:
  This dynamic test ensures the function remains relevant and functional with real-time data, testing its effectiveness annually without manual updates to the test cases.
