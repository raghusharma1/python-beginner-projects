### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2024 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule where most years divisible by 4 are leap years. This test validates the function's capability to accurately recognize such years.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2023 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function can correctly identify common years that are not leap years, adhering to the basic rule of the Gregorian calendar that most years not divisible by 4 are not leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies that the function respects the Gregorian rule that most century years (years divisible by 100) are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. This confirms the function's accuracy for special cases in the leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the exception to the century rule, where years divisible by 400 are indeed leap years. It ensures that the function can handle these exceptional cases correctly, which are critical for maintaining accuracy in date-related calculations over long periods.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies whether the current year is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it programmatically using the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False based on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is relevant and can dynamically determine the leap year status of the current year, which may be important for applications needing real-time date validations.

### Scenario 6: Test the function with the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the year zero, assuming it's treated as a leap year (historical context).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with year zero is essential as it represents a boundary condition. Although the "year zero" does not exist in the Gregorian calendar, in astronomical year numbering, it is a leap year. This test ensures the function's compatibility with different calendaring systems.
