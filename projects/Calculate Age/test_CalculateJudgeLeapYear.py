### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a standard leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, e.g., 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can accurately identify years that comply with the leap year rule, specifically those divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400. This ensures the function's reliability in basic leap year detection, adhering to standard Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, e.g., 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating that the function correctly filters out common years, maintaining the integrity of date-related calculations and operations that depend on accurate year classification.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify century years that are not leap years (like 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Testing with century years that are exceptions to the typical leap year rule is essential to verify that the function adheres to the full specification of leap year calculation, particularly the exclusion of most century years unless divisible by 400.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year at the transition of centuries
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_at_century_transition
  Description: This test verifies that the function identifies leap years correctly at the transition of centuries, specifically those divisible by 400, like the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the special rule of leap years that occur every 400 years, confirming its accuracy in complex scenarios, critical for systems depending on precise date management over long periods.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function can correctly determine leap years in the future, such as the year 2080.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2080.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Verifying the function's performance with future dates is vital for applications that plan ahead or calculate future events, ensuring long-term reliability and functionality of the leap year judgment logic.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `judge_leap_year` function works correctly across a variety of typical and edge-case conditions, maintaining robustness and reliability in its leap year determinations.
