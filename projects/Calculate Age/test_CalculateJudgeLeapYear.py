### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2024 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is crucial because 2024 is a standard leap year, divisible by 4 but not by 100, fitting the leap year rule. The expected result validates the function's ability to correctly identify such years according to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2023 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is important because 2023 is not divisible by 4, thereby not fitting the leap year rule. This scenario ensures that the function can accurately identify common non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Testing with the year 1900 is vital as it is a century year (divisible by 100) but not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400. This test confirms the function's adherence to the refined leap year rule involving century years.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is a critical test case as it is a century year divisible by 400, making it a leap year. This scenario ensures the function properly implements the exception to the century rule, confirming its accuracy for such special cases.

### Scenario 5: Test the earliest year technically supported
Details:
  TestName: test_earliest_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the earliest year technically supported by the Python date mechanisms.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  While year 1 is not a leap year, testing this boundary condition is important to ensure that the function handles the full range of valid year inputs. This test checks the function's robustness with respect to historical data handling.

### Scenario 6: Test a negative year (before common era)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies leap years before the common era (negative years).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with -4 as the parameter.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a negative year such as -4 (which would be a leap year if it were positive) checks the function's capability to correctly evaluate years in the BCE era under the same leap rules. This scenario ensures the function's comprehensive temporal coverage.
