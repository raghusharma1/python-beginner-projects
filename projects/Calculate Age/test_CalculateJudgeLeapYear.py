### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to recognize standard non-leap years, which is essential for any date-related operations, ensuring that non-leap years are not mistakenly treated as leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test checks the function with the year 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the leap year rule for century years, which is vital for accurate calendar calculations, especially in historical data analysis and future date predictions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Tests the function with the year 2000, which is a leap year being a multiple of 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies the special rule for leap years that are multiples of 400, ensuring the function's reliability over a wide range of years, including those at century boundaries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly evaluates leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains accurate over time, supporting long-term planning and date calculations in software systems.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Tests the function with the current year to determine if it is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False based on the current year's leap status.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is relevant and provides accurate results in real-time applications, which is vital for functionalities that depend on the current date.
