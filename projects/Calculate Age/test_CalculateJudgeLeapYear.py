### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years are defined as years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400. 2020 fits this criterion, and the test confirms the function's accuracy in a standard scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function accurately identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  The year 2019 is not divisible by 4, making it a non-leap year. This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify most common non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly handles century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Although 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400. This test validates the function's adherence to the additional rules concerning century years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function identifies leap years correctly when the year is a divisible by 400, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 meets the leap year criteria of being divisible by 400. This test ensures the function can correctly handle the special case of century leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when called with the current year. This helps in confirming the function's real-time applicability.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using time.localtime().
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The expected result depends on whether the current year is a leap year or not.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures the function's practical utility and relevance, confirming its operation under real-world conditions.

### Scenario 6: Test with the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_with_year_zero
  Description: Tests the function's behavior with the year zero, a boundary condition often overlooked in calendar calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 0.
  Assert: The function should return True since year 0 is technically a leap year by the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles edge cases and confirms adherence to the full scope of the Gregorian leap year rules, which include year zero as a leap year.
