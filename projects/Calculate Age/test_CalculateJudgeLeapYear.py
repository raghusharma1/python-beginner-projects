### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which are crucial for calendar-related computations in various applications.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Verifying non-leap years is as important as validating leap years to maintain the accuracy of date-related functionalities that depend on correct year type identification.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900), which is a common exception in the leap year rule.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test ensures the function correctly implements this nuanced part of the leap year rule, which is essential for accurate calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function can identify a century year that is a leap year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a year 2000 ensures the function can handle the special rule that makes century years divisible by 400 leap years. It's vital for applications requiring precise date management across centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function is capable of accurately determining leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for future dates is critical for long-term planning and scheduling applications, confirming its robustness and reliability over time.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before common era)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_negative_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response to a year in the BCE period, like -400, which should theoretically be a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year -400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Although less common, handling years before the common era correctly is important for historical data processing and educational applications, ensuring comprehensive functionality.
