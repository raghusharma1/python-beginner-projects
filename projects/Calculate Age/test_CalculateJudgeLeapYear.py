### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to recognize a common leap year, ensuring that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is correctly implemented. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  It’s essential to verify that the function correctly identifies non-leap years to prevent any errors in date-related calculations where leap years are not applicable.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_not_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, to check correct identification as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function adheres to the enhanced leap year rule that centuries are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This is vital for correct calendar computations over long ranges.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_with_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 400 to ensure it is identified as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Confirming the function’s ability to identify years that are multiples of 400 as leap years is crucial because it represents an exception to the typical century rule and is essential for accurate calendrical calculations, especially over extensive timelines.

### Scenario 5: Test with a very early year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_early_year
  Description: This test checks the function's capability to handle years far in the past, such as the year 4 AD, which is technically a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 4.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with ancient dates ensures the function's robustness and correctness across all possible valid year inputs, which is important for historical data processing or applications dealing with a wide range of dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function can correctly identify future leap years, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function can accurately predict leap years in the future is essential for planning and scheduling applications that must operate correctly in long-term scenarios.
