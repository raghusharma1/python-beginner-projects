### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function handles common leap year cases correctly.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's capability to correctly identify common years that are not leap years, ensuring it properly follows the basic rule of leap years not divisible by 4.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial as it tests the function's adherence to the refined rule of the Gregorian calendar that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This ensures the function's accuracy for less frequent, special cases.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies century years that are leap years, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is significant as it confirms the function respects the exception to the general rule for century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be considered leap years. This test ensures accuracy in handling special cases in the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a leap year far in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year ensures that the function remains accurate over time and does not suffer from any limitations related to the range or period it was initially designed to handle.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a non-leap year far in the past, such as 1800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1800.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function's logic is consistently applied regardless of the time period, confirming its reliability for historical data as well as its robustness in handling a wide range of input years.
