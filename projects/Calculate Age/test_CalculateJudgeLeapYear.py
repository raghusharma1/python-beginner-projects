### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to recognize standard non-leap years, which is essential for any date-related operations in software, ensuring correctness in scheduling and time calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test verifies that the function correctly identifies such years, using 1900 as an example.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validating this rule is critical because it affects calculations for an entire year every 100 years, impacting software that deals with long-term date calculations or historical data.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Verifies that the function identifies leap years that are multiples of 400, such as the year 2000, adhering to the leap year exception rule.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it ensures compliance with the specific exception to the leap year rule, which helps maintain accuracy in date and time functionalities over centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years in the future, such as the year 2040.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2040.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains reliable as time progresses, supporting software scalability and future-proofing date-based functionalities.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to accurately determine the leap year status of years far in the past, such as the year 800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 800.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that historical data and applications requiring long-range historical accuracy can rely on the function, which is vital for archiving, research, and educational software.
