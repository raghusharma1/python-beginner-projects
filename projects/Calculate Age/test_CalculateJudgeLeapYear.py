### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function can correctly identify such years, which is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly identifies typical non-leap years, ensuring that the function properly adheres to the simplest rule of the leap year calculation (years not divisible by 4).

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is vital as it checks the function's compliance with the exception to the leap year rule: most century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This ensures the function can handle such exceptions, which is crucial for accurate date handling over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year that is a century and divisible by 400, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles the special rule that makes century years that are divisible by 400 leap years. This is crucial for accuracy in applications that perform operations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with the minimum boundary year input
Details:
  TestName: test_with_minimum_year_boundary
  Description: Tests the function with the smallest integer value typically supported, such as the year 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's robustness and correctness when handling edge cases at the boundary of typical date ranges, ensuring reliability in diverse historical or projected date calculations.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the function `judge_leap_year` adheres to all rules and exceptions of the Gregorian calendar concerning leap year calculations, making it reliable for any application requiring date management.
