### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for a standard leap year, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules where every fourth year is generally a leap year.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately identifies years that do not meet the leap year criteria, which is crucial for any applications dependent on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the rule that only century years divisible by 400 are leap years. It's crucial for validating the function's compliance with more complex leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function identifies a leap year when the year is a divisible by 400 century, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the correct implementation of the leap year rule for century years that are divisible by 400. This is important for precise date management in long-term calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test the minimum valid year input
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_year
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with the smallest valid year input, typically year 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: The function should return `False` (since 1 is not a leap year).
Validation:
  Testing the boundary condition at the start of the Gregorian calendar ensures that the function handles all possible valid inputs correctly.

### Scenario 6: Test a year that is part of a four-year cycle but not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year_in_four_year_cycle
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a year that is part of the usual four-year cycle but is not a leap year, such as 2022.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2022.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function accurately identifies non-leap years within the common four-year cycle, supporting reliable year-based calculations and planning.
