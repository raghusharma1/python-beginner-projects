### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary requirement. The year 2024 is chosen because it is a standard example of a leap year, adhering to the rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years unless divisible by 100 and not by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns False.
Validation:
  The test confirms the function's ability to recognize standard non-leap years, which is crucial for its accuracy. The year 2023 is a typical example of a non-leap year, not meeting any criteria of a leap year.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests if the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. The year 1900 is not divisible by 400, thus it is crucial to validate that the function does not incorrectly categorize it as a leap year.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies a century year that is indeed a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns True.
Validation:
  The test is important to confirm the function's ability to recognize the special rule for century years that are divisible by 400. The year 2000 meets this criterion, making it a valid leap year, and the function should correctly identify it as such.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Tests the function's response to the current year, verifying its real-time utility.
Execution:
  Arrange: Determine the current year using `time.localtime().tm_year`.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year as the parameter.
  Assert: Manually verify and assert whether the function's return matches the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the function's practical application in real-time scenarios, ensuring it remains relevant and accurate as time progresses. It helps in confirming that the function can dynamically handle the passage of time without requiring updates for each new year.
