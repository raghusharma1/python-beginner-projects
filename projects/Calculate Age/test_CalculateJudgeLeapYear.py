### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400. This scenario confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules regarding leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test for a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function accurately identifies years that do not meet the leap year criteria. It helps ensure that the function does not falsely classify common years as leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario is significant because it tests the function's compliance with the exception to the leap year rule, which states that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. It ensures the function's accuracy for special cases in the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 4: Test for a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Ensures the function identifies leap years that are multiples of 400, such as 2000, correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function properly handles the special rule for century years that are leap years because they are divisible by 400. It ensures that the function can accurately classify these exceptional leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Checks whether the function correctly identifies if the current year is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year using time.localtime().tm_year.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Check the function's return against the expected result based on the current year's leap year status.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year is a practical scenario that ensures the function operates correctly in real-time and validates its ongoing relevance and accuracy in real-world applications. This can help in scenarios where software relies on date calculations for current year operations.
