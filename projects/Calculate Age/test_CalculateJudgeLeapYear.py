### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years, which is a fundamental aspect of date-time calculations impacting functionalities that depend on accurate date handling.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly reject a common year that is not a leap year, confirming the function's utility in routine date-time calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario checks for the special rule in the Gregorian calendar that centennial years are not leap years unless divisible by 400, ensuring the function's accuracy over a wide range of dates.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a century year that is also a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the complete set of rules for leap years, particularly the exception for years divisible by 400, which is critical for accurate long-range calendar calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's response to a far future leap year, ensuring its long-term applicability.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Confirms the function's reliability for future date calculations, which is essential for applications planning far ahead, such as astronomical software or long-term scheduling systems.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimum edge case year
Details:
  TestName: test_min_edge_case_year
  Description: Tests the function with the smallest integer typically supported, which can be critical for historical data processing.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases near the start of the Gregorian calendar, important for historical or archival applications where such dates might be relevant.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the function `judge_leap_year` operates correctly across a variety of typical and edge cases, adhering to the rules of the Gregorian calendar and remaining robust in both typical usage and more unusual or extreme date calculations.
