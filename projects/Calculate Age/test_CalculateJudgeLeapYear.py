### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are those divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures the function can accurately identify a clear-cut case of a leap year, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to reject a typical non-leap year, ensuring the function's reliability in handling the most common scenario where the year is not divisible by 4.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900), which is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the refined leap year rule involving century years. It's vital for ensuring accuracy in scenarios involving historical data or projections far into the future.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function with a year like 2000, which is a leap year despite being a century because it is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies the special case of century leap years, which is essential for correct date handling in software dealing with a range of historical or future date data.

### Scenario 5: Test with a very early year
Details:
  TestName: test_early_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly evaluate years far in the past, such as the year 4, which is technically a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the year 4.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test is significant for applications that might deal with historical calendars and need to verify leap year calculations for years long before the common era.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate a future leap year, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the judge_leap_year function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle years well into the future, ensuring its utility for long-term planning and future date calculations in applications.
