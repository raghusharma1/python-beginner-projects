### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to recognize a common leap year, ensuring that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is correctly implemented. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function’s accuracy in identifying years that do not meet the leap year criteria. Correctly identifying non-leap years is essential for date-sensitive computations in real-world applications.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900), which is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Validates the correct implementation of the special rule for century years in leap year calculation. This ensures the function can handle exceptions in the leap year rules, which is vital for accurate calendrical functions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies the function’s ability to identify a century year that is also a leap year (e.g., 2000), which is divisible by both 100 and 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's compliance with the complete set of leap year rules, confirming its capability to correctly evaluate years that are exceptions due to the century rule. This is crucial for applications that depend on precise date and time management over long periods.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function can correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's robustness and reliability in handling years well beyond the current era, which is important for long-term planning and simulations in software applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify the function’s ability to evaluate a non-leap year far in the past, such as the year 1700.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1700.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function’s effectiveness across a wide range of historical dates, ensuring its utility in historical data processing or applications requiring extensive date range support.
