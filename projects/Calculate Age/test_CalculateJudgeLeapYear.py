### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years; thus, 2020 is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2020)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule for leap years, which is fundamental to ensuring that date-related calculations are accurate.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year. For example, 2019 is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2019)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the function can distinguish non-leap years, which is essential for any application relying on accurate year classification for scheduling or calendaring.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900. Although divisible by 4, it is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's compliance with the leap year rule excluding most century years, which is vital for applications involving historical dates or long-term planning.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year that is divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 400 as a leap year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the function correctly handles the exception to the century rule in the Gregorian calendar, which is critical for ensuring accuracy in calendaring systems, especially those that deal with a span of multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly identify a future leap year, such as 2040.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2040)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates confirms the function's ongoing reliability, crucial for applications in planning and forecasting that rely on future date calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before common era)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles years before the common era (negative numbers), such as -400, which should technically be a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(-400)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test is essential for applications that might deal with historical data extending back before the common era, ensuring the function's versatility and accuracy in handling a wide range of years.
