### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years, which state that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly apply leap year rules, confirming that years not divisible by 4 are not leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical because although 1900 is divisible by 4, it is not a leap year since century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. It validates that the function correctly implements this rule.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's adherence to the rule that century years divisible by 400 are leap years, an exception to the general rule that century years are not leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test the minimum edge year
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_edge_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly handles the smallest integer typically representable, which is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases involving very small year values, which are technically valid within the Gregorian calendar context.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures the function can correctly identify a leap year far in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a future leap year, such as 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness and accuracy in predicting leap years in the distant future, ensuring its utility for long-term planning and scheduling applications.
