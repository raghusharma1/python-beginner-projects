### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures the function accurately identifies common non-leap years. This test is crucial for confirming the function's ability to discern years that do not meet the leap year criteria.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This scenario tests the function's compliance with this less frequent but important rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Ensures the function identifies leap years that are multiples of 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle the special rule for century leap years, confirming its accuracy even in less common scenarios that are crucial for correct calendar calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Verifies how the function handles the year zero, which is technically a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(0).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing year zero checks the function's robustness and compliance with the extended rules of the Gregorian calendar, ensuring its utility in historical or theoretical contexts.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies future leap years, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2044).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensures the function remains accurate for future dates, supporting its use in forward-looking applications and planning tools.

### Scenario 7: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's response to a future non-leap year, such as 2049.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2049).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ongoing accuracy and reliability for future dates, crucial for applications involving future date calculations.
