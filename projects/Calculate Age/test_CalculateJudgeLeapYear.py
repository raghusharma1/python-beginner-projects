### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years. This is a fundamental requirement for the function to meet the expected behavior for leap year calculation.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify common non-leap years, which is critical for any application dependent on accurate date-time calculations, such as scheduling and calendaring systems.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, such as 1900, to ensure it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the additional rule that only centuries divisible by 400 are leap years. This is essential for precise calendrical calculations, especially over long time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function identifies centuries that are also leap years, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly applies the complex part of the leap year rule involving centuries, which is crucial for correct date handling across millennia.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function can correctly determine the leap year status for a year far in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year ensures that the function remains reliable for future dates, supporting long-term usability in applications like long-term planning tools or historical research.

### Scenario 6: Test with the earliest year in the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_gregorian_start_year
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1582, the first year of the Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1582.
  Assert: The function should return False (1582 is not a leap year).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case of the Gregorian calendar's starting year, which is vital for historical data processing and educational applications that may require accurate calendar calculations from the onset of the currently used calendar system.
