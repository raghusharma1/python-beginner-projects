### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400, aligning with the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical common year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_common_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known common year, such as 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Validating the function's response to non-leap years ensures it is reliable for typical use cases, adhering to the standard leap year rules.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the leap year exception rule for century years, which are not leap years unless divisible by 400, ensuring accurate calendrical calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function correctly applies the additional rule for century years, which must also be divisible by 400 to be considered leap years. It validates the function's precision in handling special cases.

### Scenario 5: Test the lower boundary of leap year calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_lower_boundary_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior at the lower boundary of the Gregorian calendar's leap year rule, using the year 1582.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1582.
  Assert: The function should return `True` as 1582 is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing the boundary where the Gregorian calendar leap year rules started is crucial for historical data processing and applications requiring precise date calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function can correctly predict leap years in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to handle future dates, which is essential for planning and scheduling applications that extend far into the future.

### Scenario 7: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Verifies the function's handling of years far before the Gregorian calendar implementation, such as the year 1000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1000.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's robustness in dealing with historical data, important for applications dealing with a wide range of historical documents or events.
