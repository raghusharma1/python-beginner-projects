### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures the function can accurately identify a clear, uncontroversial leap year, confirming its basic operational correctness according to Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's ability to reject years that do not meet leap year criteria, ensuring accurate and reliable date-related calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, such as 1900, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the more nuanced rule of the Gregorian calendar regarding century years, which is critical for accurate date processing in long-term applications.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a leap year when the year is divisible by 400, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a year 2000 ensures the function adheres to the full set of rules defining leap years, which is vital for systems relying on precise date calculations over centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_year
  Description: Ensures the function can correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness and forward compatibility by verifying it works correctly with years well beyond the current date, ensuring its utility for long-term future planning.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_past_year
  Description: Checks if the function can correctly evaluate a leap year far in the past, such as the year 1600.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1600.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles dates long before the present, confirming its applicability to historical data and ensuring its accuracy for historical analysis or applications.
