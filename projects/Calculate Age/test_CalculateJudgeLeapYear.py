ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=judge_leap_year_4548bc7362


### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing this test is crucial as it checks the primary functionality of the method to identify typical leap years, which align with the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately identifies standard years that are not leap years. Correctly filtering non-leap years is essential for the function's accuracy.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900, to ensure it handles century exceptions correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test checks the function's compliance with this rule, which is a critical aspect of leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Ensures the function identifies leap years that are multiples of 400, such as 2000, correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with years like 2000 validates that the function adheres to the leap year rule for centurial years, which is vital for its precision and reliability.

### Scenario 5: Test with the minimum boundary year input
Details:
  TestName: test_with_minimum_boundary_year
  Description: Tests the function with the smallest integer value typically supported, which is 1, to see if it handles historical years correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  While the Gregorian calendar starts from 1582, testing from year 1 ensures the function's robustness and correctness throughout a broader historical context.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly predict future leap years, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  It's essential to verify the function's accuracy for future dates to ensure its ongoing applicability and reliability in long-term planning and computations.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `judge_leap_year` function works correctly across a variety of typical and edge-case inputs, adhering to the rules of the Gregorian calendar and ensuring its utility in real-world applications.
