### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2024)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The year 2024 is chosen as it is a standard leap year, divisible by 4 but not by 100.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2023)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately identifies common non-leap years, aligning with the Gregorian calendar rules. The year 2023 is a common year that is not divisible by 4.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to identify century years that are not leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test confirms the function's adherence to this rule, using the year 1900 which is divisible by 100 but not 400.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a leap year that is a multiple of 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function respects the exception to the century rule, identifying 2000 as a leap year because it is divisible by 400. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy with the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to correctly predict future leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2400)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future years like 2400, which are correctly divisible by 4 and 400, ensures that the function will remain reliable as time progresses, maintaining its utility in long-term applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before the Gregorian calendar adoption)
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_negative_year
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with years prior to the adoption of the Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(-100)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  This test is important for historical data handling, ensuring that the function can process years from before the Gregorian calendar's implementation, even though leap year rules were different/non-existent.
