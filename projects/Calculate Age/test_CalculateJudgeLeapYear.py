### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that any year divisible by 4 is a leap year unless it is a century not divisible by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to correctly identify a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately identifies standard years that do not meet the conditions of a leap year, confirming its ability to distinguish between leap and non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is critical because it checks the function's compliance with the special rule of the Gregorian calendar that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This ensures the function's accuracy over a broader range of years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function recognizes a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies the function's adherence to the exception in the leap year rule concerning century years, which must be divisible by 400. This test confirms the function can handle exceptional leap year cases correctly.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verify whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it from the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The result should match the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year is useful for real-time system checks and ensures the function's utility remains consistent and accurate with contemporary dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Validate the function's behavior when given the year zero, which is technically a leap year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 0.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle edge cases in historical date calculations, verifying its robustness and accuracy in a broader historical context.
