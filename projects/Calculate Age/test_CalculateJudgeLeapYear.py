### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years are defined as years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400. 2020 fits this criterion, and thus this test confirms the function's compliance with leap year rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Since 2019 is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year. This test ensures that the function accurately identifies non-leap years according to the standard rules.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years (e.g., 1900, 1800) are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test checks the function's ability to handle special cases in leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a century year that is a leap year, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is a leap year as it is divisible by 400. This test verifies the function's adherence to the full set of rules defining leap years, including exceptions for certain century years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year like 2400 (which is a leap year) ensures that the function remains accurate regardless of the year input, confirming its robustness and reliability over time.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies leap years in the distant past, such as the year 1600.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1600.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 1600 is a valid leap year (divisible by 400). This test ensures that the function handles historical data accurately, which is important for applications dealing with historical dates.
