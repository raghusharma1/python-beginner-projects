### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2024.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which are crucial for calendar-related computations in various applications.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2023.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Verifying non-leap years is as important as validating leap years to maintain accuracy in date-handling functionalities across software systems.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test ensures the function's compliance with this nuanced part of leap year rules, which is vital for correct date processing.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: To verify that the function identifies a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the correct application of the complete set of leap year rules, including the special rule for years divisible by 400. It's essential for ensuring accuracy in applications requiring precise date calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function's reliability over time, supporting long-term usability in applications dealing with future dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with the smallest possible integer (boundary test)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_small_negative_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response when given a small negative year, such as -1, testing the function's robustness with unexpected or extreme values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function `judge_leap_year` with the year -1.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Although historical and future year calculations are typical use cases, ensuring that the function gracefully handles atypical input like negative years validates its robustness and error handling.
