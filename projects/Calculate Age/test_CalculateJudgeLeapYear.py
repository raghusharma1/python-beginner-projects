### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to recognize a leap year that meets the standard criteria (divisible by 4). This ensures the function is adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules, which are fundamental to date handling in many systems.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's capability to correctly identify common years that do not qualify as leap years. It's crucial for ensuring the function's reliability in handling most of the year inputs correctly.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be False.
Validation:
  Century years are a special case in leap year calculation (they must be divisible by 400 to be leap years). This test ensures the function correctly applies these extended rules.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's correct application of the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400. It verifies the function's adherence to the full scope of the Gregorian calendar leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the year zero, which is technically a leap year in astronomical year numbering.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  Testing the year zero is important as it is a boundary case in many date-related calculations. Ensuring correct behavior provides confidence in the function's robustness.

### Scenario 6: Test a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function can correctly identify a future leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 2420 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's effectiveness with future dates, ensuring it remains valid for future use without requiring modification as new years occur.

### Scenario 7: Test a negative year (before common era)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles years before the common era (negative years) and identifies leap years correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with -400 as the parameter.
  Assert: Expect the result to be True.
Validation:
  While less common in typical applications, handling negative years correctly is important for historical data calculations and ensures the function's versatility and correctness across all possible year values.
