### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years. This is a fundamental requirement for the function to meet the expected behavior for leap year calculation.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify common non-leap years, which is critical for any application dependent on accurate date-time calculations, such as scheduling and calendaring systems.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a century (e.g., 1900) which is not a leap year as it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's compliance with the additional rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This is crucial for maintaining long-term accuracy in applications involving date calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Validates the function with a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's correctness in identifying century years that are leap years, critical for applications that perform date operations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year
  Description: Verifies whether the function correctly identifies if the current year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it from the system clock.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Manually check if the current year is a leap year and ensure the functionâ€™s output matches.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-time data ensures that the function remains reliable under actual operating conditions, crucial for real-time systems and applications that depend on current date-time data.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to correctly predict leap years well into the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function remains accurate for future dates, which is essential for planning and simulations that require long-term date calculations.

These scenarios cover a comprehensive range of situations, ensuring thorough testing of the leap year determination logic encapsulated in the `judge_leap_year` function.
