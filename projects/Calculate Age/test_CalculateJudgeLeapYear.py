### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures the function can correctly identify straightforward cases of leap years, which is essential for any calendar-related computations that depend on accurate leap year identification.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly reject common non-leap years, which is critical for maintaining accurate date and time calculations in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 to confirm it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's compliance with the special rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400, which is crucial for correct calendar alignment over long time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by both 100 and 400 as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the leap year rule for centuries, which is essential for accurate date management and historical data alignment.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's ability to determine leap years in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function with a future leap year, such as 2044.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function remains reliable as time progresses, supporting planning and scheduling applications that depend on future data.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly identify non-leap years in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function with a future non-leap year, such as 2049.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function works with future non-leap years is crucial for applications involving long-term planning and date calculations, ensuring they remain accurate and reliable over time.
