### Test Scenarios for the `judge_leap_year` Function

#### Scenario 1: Testing with a Common Year
Details:
  TestName: test_common_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a common year (non-leap year).
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a common year such as 2021.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2021)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the function can accurately differentiate between common years and leap years, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Testing with a Leap Year Divisible by 4
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_4
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a leap year such as 2024.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2024)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  Testing leap years divisible by 4 validates that the function adheres to one of the primary rules for determining leap years in the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Testing with a Year Divisible by 100 but not 400
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Test that the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 as a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a year like 1900.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly applies the exception to the leap year rule for century years that are not divisible by 400, which is a subtlety in the Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 4: Testing with a Year Divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a year divisible by 400 as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a year like 2000.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles the special case of years divisible by 400, which are leap years despite being century years.

#### Scenario 5: Testing with the Current Year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verify the function's correctness for the current year, checking if it's a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(current_year)`, where `current_year` is dynamically determined.
  Assert: Manually check if the current year is a leap year and expect the result accordingly.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function performs correctly in the context of real-time data, which is essential for applications needing current date context validation.

#### Scenario 6: Testing with the Year Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with the year zero, which is technically a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 0.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(0)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  Although year zero is not used in the Gregorian calendar, this test ensures that the leap year calculation logic is robust even for edge cases or historical context applications.

These scenarios cover a comprehensive range of inputs to validate the correctness of the `judge_leap_year` function, ensuring it behaves as expected across all different types of years defined by leap year rules.
