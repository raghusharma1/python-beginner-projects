### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years divisible by 4.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, confirming its reliability and accuracy in handling the most common scenario.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test ensures that the function adheres to this refined rule, which is vital for maintaining accuracy over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Validate the function with a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the exceptional rule for century years divisible by 400. It's essential for ensuring the function's robustness in handling special cases defined by the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years in the future, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2044).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains relevant and accurate as time progresses, vital for applications needing long-term date evaluations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Test the function with a year far in the past, such as 800, to ensure it handles historical dates accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(800).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to confirm that the function's algorithm is not only applicable to recent and near-future years but also accurately evaluates years from distant past. This is crucial for historical data analysis and applications in fields like research or genealogy.

### Scenario 7: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year
  Description: Checks if the function accurately evaluates the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The result should match the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function is immediately relevant and can be used dynamically in applications that require real-time date processing, such as calendaring or scheduling systems.
