### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2024`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that leap years occur every four years; however, years divisible by 100 and not by 400 are not leap years. The year 2024 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, making it a valid leap year. The test validates the function's ability to correctly assess such cases.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2023`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2023 is not divisible by 4, thus it is not a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar rules. This test ensures that the function appropriately identifies years that do not meet the leap year criteria.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function identifies century years that are not leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `1900`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that although 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400. The function must correctly recognize that it does not qualify as a leap year under the extended rules of the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 4: Test a century year which is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function identifies century years that are leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2000`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2000 is divisible by both 100 and 400, qualifying it as a leap year. This test confirms that the function correctly applies the full set of rules for determining leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test the transition from a non-leap year to a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_transition_to_leap_year
  Description: Verify the function's response when transitioning from a non-leap year to a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function sequentially with the parameters `2023` and `2024`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False` for 2023 and `True` for 2024.
Validation:
  Rationalize that checking consecutive years tests the function's consistency and correctness across a boundary condition where the leap year rule changes. This ensures the function remains accurate over continuous yearly inputs.

### Scenario 6: Test the earliest technically valid year (year 1)
Details:
  TestName: test_earliest_year
  Description: Verify that the function can handle the smallest possible year in the Gregorian calendar context.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `1`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 1 is not divisible by 4, hence it is not a leap year. This test ensures that the function can accurately evaluate years at the very beginning of the currently used calendar system.

Each scenario ensures comprehensive coverage of the function's behavior across different types of years, adhering to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years. These tests collectively validate the correctness and robustness of the `judge_leap_year` function.
