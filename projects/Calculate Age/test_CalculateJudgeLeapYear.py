### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function accurately recognizes standard leap years, aligning with the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years unless they are divisible by 100 but not by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can distinguish typical years that are not leap years, which is vital for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a century (e.g., 1900) and not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the special rule of the Gregorian calendar that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. It's crucial for validating the function's adherence to more complex leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies leap years that are divisible by 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the full leap year rule, including the exception for years divisible by 400. It's crucial for accurate date management over long periods, such as historical or astronomical datasets.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to determine leap years in the future, such as 2040.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2040 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for future dates is vital for planning and forecasting applications that depend on date calculations extending into the future.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before the Gregorian calendar adoption)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Checks how the function handles years before 1582, such as -100 (100 BC).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with -100 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False (assuming the Gregorian calendar rules are not applied before 1582).
Validation:
  This test is important for historical applications that might require date calculations before the Gregorian calendar was adopted. It helps to ensure that the function can handle such edge cases correctly, though historical accuracy might not be strictly adhered to.
