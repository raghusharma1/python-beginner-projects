### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2020, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is implemented correctly. Ensuring the function recognizes typical leap years is fundamental to its accuracy and reliability.

### Scenario 2: Test for a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year, such as 2019, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  It's crucial for the function to correctly identify non-leap years to avoid miscalculations in applications depending on accurate date management (e.g., calendaring or scheduling applications).

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years (e.g., 1900) because they are not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the refined leap year rule involving century years, which is critical for maintaining long-term calendar accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test for a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function recognizes century years that are actually leap years (e.g., 2000), because they are divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the correct implementation of the complete leap year rule, including its exception for years divisible by 400. This is essential for correct date calculations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test for the earliest year boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_earliest_year_boundary
  Description: Ensures that the function can handle the boundary condition by testing it with the earliest valid Gregorian calendar year, 1582.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1582 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True` as 1582 is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing boundary conditions like the introduction of the Gregorian calendar ensures robustness in historical data applications and adherence to calendar standards.

### Scenario 6: Test for a future typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly predict future leap years, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2044 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for future dates guarantees its utility in long-term planning and forecasting applications, which depend on precise date calculations.
