### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, such as 2020 or 2024.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2024)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the function can accurately identify standard leap years, which is fundamental to the function's purpose and business requirements related to date and time calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2023)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly rejects years that do not meet the leap year criteria, avoiding errors in calculations that depend on accurate year type determination.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  Century years are a special case in leap year calculation. This test ensures the function adheres to the full leap year rule, maintaining accuracy in broader date-related functionalities.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function with a year like 2000 that is divisible by 400 and thus a leap year despite being a century.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Ensure the result is `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies the function's capability to handle exceptions in the leap year rule (century years that are divisible by 400). Itâ€™s essential for ensuring accuracy in applications that require precise date handling, such as calendaring or scheduling systems.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly evaluate a future year that is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2400)`.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future years ensures the function remains reliable over time, supporting long-term planning and future date calculations which are critical in long-range planning applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a distant past year that is not a leap year to check the historical accuracy.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1700)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for past dates is essential for historical data analysis and applications that need to manage or display historical information accurately.
