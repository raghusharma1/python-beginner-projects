### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Leap years are every four years; however, years divisible by 100 and not by 400 are not leap years. 2024 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, making it a leap year. The function should accurately detect this, confirming its reliability in typical conditions.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: This test determines if the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Since 2023 is not divisible by 4, it is not a leap year. This test verifies that the function correctly applies leap year rules to standard years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to identify a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. Since 1900 is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year. This test ensures the function adheres to more complex leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The year 2000 is divisible by 400, making it a leap year despite being a century year. This test confirms the function's capability to correctly apply the exception rule for century years.

### Scenario 5: Test with the smallest possible input
Details:
  TestName: test_with_year_one
  Description: Validate the function's behavior with the smallest logically possible year input, which is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The year 1 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year. Testing with edge case values like this ensures the function handles all possible valid inputs correctly.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases, ensuring that the `judge_leap_year` function is robust, reliable, and adheres to the defined rules for identifying leap years.
