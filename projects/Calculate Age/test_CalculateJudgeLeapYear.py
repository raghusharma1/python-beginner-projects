ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=judge_leap_year_4548bc7362


### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing this test is crucial as it checks the primary functionality of the method to identify typical leap years, which align with the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is essential for confirming that the function accurately identifies standard years that do not meet leap year conditions.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to handle exceptions in the leap year rule concerning century years, which is a critical aspect of the leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Validates the function with a year that is a multiple of 400, like 2000, which is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario is significant as it checks the function's compliance with the special rule for century years that are multiples of 400, ensuring comprehensive leap year detection.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year
  Description: Ensures the function works correctly with the current year, which varies as time progresses.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Manually verify the result matches the expected leap year status for the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures that the function remains relevant and functional in real-time scenarios, adapting to changes as years progress.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_far_future_year
  Description: Checks the function's response to a year far in the future, such as 2400, to test robustness over long time spans.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is vital for ensuring the function's longevity and reliability, confirming that it can handle input values that span a significant range of years.
