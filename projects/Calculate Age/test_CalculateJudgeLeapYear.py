### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The year 2024 is chosen as it is a standard example of a leap year, adhering to the rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years unless they are divisible by 100 but not by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to distinguish non-leap years, which is crucial for its accuracy and reliability. The year 2023 is a standard example of a non-leap year, not meeting the leap year conditions.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. Testing with 1900 validates the function's adherence to this nuanced rule, ensuring its accuracy in special cases.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a century year that is also a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is a leap year despite being a century year because it is divisible by 400. This test confirms the function's capability to handle exceptions to the typical leap year rules, which is essential for its complete accuracy.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verify if the function correctly identifies whether the current year is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the `time` module to get the current year.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct leap status (True or False) based on the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures the function's relevance and reliability in real-time applications, providing a dynamic assessment of its accuracy in everyday use.
