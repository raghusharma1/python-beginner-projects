### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. Testing with 2020 confirms the function handles the common leap year rule correctly.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a common non-leap year to ensure it correctly returns False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the functionâ€™s ability to correctly identify regular years that are not leap years, which is crucial for accurate date handling.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, like 1900, to ensure it correctly identifies it as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the special rule that centuries are not leap years unless divisible by 400. It's important to validate this to ensure the function handles all nuances of the leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year that is divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that years divisible by 400, such as 2000, are correctly identified as leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the exception to the century rule, ensuring that the function can handle complex leap year rules correctly.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Tests the function with the current year to see if it correctly identifies it as a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using the time module.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: The result should match the expected leap year status for the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-time data ensures the function remains relevant and accurate under real-world conditions, adapting to changes in year.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly predict a future leap year, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function works with future dates is essential for long-term usability in applications requiring date calculations extending into the future.

### Scenario 7: Test with a far past non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_far_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy with historical data by testing a year long before the current era, such as 800 (a non-leap year).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 800.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is not only applicable to contemporary and near-future dates but also accurate for historical date calculations. This is crucial for applications dealing with historical data.
