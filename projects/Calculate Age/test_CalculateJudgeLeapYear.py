### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to recognize a common leap year, ensuring that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is correctly implemented. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function’s accuracy in identifying years that do not meet the leap year criteria. It's essential for maintaining the integrity of date-related functionalities that depend on distinguishing between leap and non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Validating this scenario ensures that the function adheres to the refined leap year rule, which states that century years must also be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This is critical for correct calendar calculations, especially in historical data analysis.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year that is exactly divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_with_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: This test ensures the function identifies a year that is exactly divisible by 400 as a leap year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm the function’s compliance with the complete set of leap year rules, particularly the exception for years divisible by 400. It ensures reliability in calendar computations across centennial transitions.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to evaluate the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it from the system's date.
  Act: Invoke the function with the current year.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected leap year status for the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures that the function performs correctly in real-time applications, which is essential for systems that rely on up-to-date date calculations. This scenario also helps in validating the function's dynamic response to changing dates.
