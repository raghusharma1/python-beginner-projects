### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2020, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is implemented correctly. Ensuring the function recognizes typical leap years is fundamental to its accuracy and reliability.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year, such as 2019, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly applies the rule for most years that are not divisible by 4, which is critical for correct differentiation between leap and non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Test the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, confirming it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function adheres to the special rule for century years, which are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. This ensures the function's precision in special cases.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Verifying the function's behavior for years divisible by 400 ensures it complies with the complete set of leap year rules, maintaining accuracy for these exceptional century years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a future leap year, such as 2040, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ongoing reliability and its capability to handle dates beyond the current year, which is crucial for planning and scheduling applications that rely on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year if it's a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Determines whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `time.localtime().tm_year` to get the current year.
  Act: Pass the current year to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True` if it's a leap year, otherwise `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function is relevant and provides accurate results in real-time applications, which is essential for functionalities that depend on the current date.
