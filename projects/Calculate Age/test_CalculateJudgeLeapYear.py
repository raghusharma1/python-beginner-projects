### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The year 2024 is chosen as it is a standard example of a leap year, adhering to the rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years unless divisible by 100 and not by 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function can distinguish non-leap years. The year 2023 is a common example of a non-leap year, which is not divisible by 4, thus should not qualify as a leap year according to the rules.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Testing century years is vital since they do not follow the simple divisibility by 4 rule. The year 1900, despite being divisible by 100, is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400. This test confirms the function's adherence to the complete leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is a critical test case for leap year calculation because it is a century year divisible by 400, thus it is a leap year. This test ensures the function correctly implements the exception to the century rule.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to determine leap years in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2400.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function remains relevant and accurate in long-term usage. The year 2400, similar to 2000, is a future century year divisible by 400, making it a leap year. This scenario validates the function's consistency over time.

Each scenario is designed to verify the function's compliance with the different rules and exceptions of what constitutes a leap year, ensuring robustness and reliability in its leap year determinations.
