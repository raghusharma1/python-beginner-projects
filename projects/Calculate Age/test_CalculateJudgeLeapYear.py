### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures the function accurately identifies common non-leap years. This test is crucial for confirming the function's ability to distinguish between leap and non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test confirms the function adheres to this less common rule, which is critical for its accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly implements the special rule for century years divisible by 400. It's vital for ensuring the functionâ€™s comprehensive accuracy across all types of years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year at the boundary of the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_year
  Description: Validates the function with a year at the boundary of the Gregorian reform, such as 1582.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1582).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures the function is robust and handles historical boundaries correctly. The Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, and this test helps confirm the function's behavior at significant historical points.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2400).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains accurate regardless of the year input, preparing the software for long-term use and confirming its ongoing reliability.
