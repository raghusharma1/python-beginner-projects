### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400. This scenario confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules regarding leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function accurately identifies typical years that are not leap years, adhering to the leap year rules which exclude most years not divisible by 4.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, such as 1900, to ensure it is identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the function correctly applies the special rule for century years, where only those divisible by 400 are leap years. This is crucial for accuracy over long periods, especially in historical data contexts.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function identifies century years that are also leap years, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly recognizes century years that meet the leap year exception (divisible by 400). It is critical for maintaining accuracy in date-related calculations over centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to determine leap year status for a year well into the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is important for verifying that the function's logic remains valid for future dates, ensuring the application's longevity and reliability in long-term future planning or projections.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimal valid year input (1 AD)
Details:
  TestName: test_minimal_year_input
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1, the minimal valid Gregorian calendar year, to ensure it handles edge cases correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Testing with the minimal year input ensures that the function can handle edge case inputs without errors, which is essential for historical data processing and applications requiring a wide range of date inputs.
