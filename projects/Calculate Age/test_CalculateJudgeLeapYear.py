### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2020, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is implemented correctly. Ensuring the function recognizes typical leap years is fundamental to its accuracy and reliability.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year, such as 2021, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function properly handles the most common scenario, a typical non-leap year. Correctly identifying non-leap years is essential for the function's overall utility and correctness.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function identifies century years that are not leap years (e.g., 1900) correctly, leveraging the rule that only centuries divisible by 400 are leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the extended rules for leap years concerning century years. It's critical for accuracy in applications that span multiple centuries.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies years that are divisible by 400 as leap years (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the exception to the century rule, ensuring the function can correctly identify the special case of centuries that are leap years. This is crucial for historical data and applications requiring precise date calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with the smallest possible year input
Details:
  TestName: test_smallest_year_input
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with the smallest valid input, which is year 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False` since year 1 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's handling of boundary conditions at the start of the Gregorian calendar. Ensuring correct behavior at boundary values is important for data integrity and application robustness.
