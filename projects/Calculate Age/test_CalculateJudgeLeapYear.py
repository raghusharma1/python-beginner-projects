### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function handles common leap year cases correctly.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's capability to correctly identify common years that are not leap years, ensuring it properly follows the basic rule of leap years not divisible by 4.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial as it tests the function's adherence to the refined rule of the Gregorian calendar, which states that a century year must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. This ensures the function does not incorrectly classify all century years as leap years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a year 2000 checks the function's compliance with the exception to the century rule, which is crucial for accurate calendar calculations, ensuring that it can correctly identify leap years that are exactly divisible by 400.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly predict leap years in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's robustness and accuracy in handling dates beyond the current era, which is important for future-proofing applications that rely on date calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies non-leap years in the future, such as 2401.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2401.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function can accurately identify non-leap years in the future is important for applications that deal with long-term planning or scheduling, verifying the function's continued reliability.
