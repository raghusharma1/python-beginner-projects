### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying the function's ability to correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400. This ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is critical to confirm that the function can accurately distinguish years that do not meet the leap year criteria, ensuring that the function's utility spans all year types.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year like 1900, which is divisible by 100 and not by 400, and therefore not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the additional rule for leap years that century years must be divisible by 400 to be considered leap years. This ensures the function's accuracy over a broader range of years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function with a year like 2000, which is divisible by 100 and 400, making it a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function correctly applies the leap year rule for century years, which must be divisible by 400. This test is vital for validating the function's effectiveness across all possible leap year scenarios.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years that are far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year checks the function's reliability and robustness over an extended timeline, confirming its utility well beyond the current dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimum valid year input
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_year_input
  Description: Tests the function with the smallest conceivable year input, year 1, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function handles edge cases at the beginning of the Gregorian calendar system, ensuring comprehensive functionality from the start of the calendar era.
