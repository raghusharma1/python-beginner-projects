### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400. The year 2020 meets the first condition but not the exceptions, hence it is correctly identified as a leap year. This test ensures the function can identify standard leap years, adhering to known leap year rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  The year 2019 is not divisible by 4, making it a non-leap year. This test checks the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, which is crucial for any operations dependent on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. Since 1900 is not divisible by 400, it should not be counted as a leap year. This test is crucial to ensure that the function correctly handles the special rule for century years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function with a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is a century year and is divisible by 400, making it a leap year. This test ensures the function's compliance with the nuanced leap year rule involving century years, which is essential for accurate date-related calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy with a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future years like 2400, which are correctly leap years, ensures the function's ongoing reliability and correctness in future scenarios, maintaining its utility in long-term applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_ancient_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a non-leap year far in the past, such as 1700.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1700.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for historical dates, like 1700 which is a century year not divisible by 400, is vital for applications involving historical data or long-term records. This test confirms the function's effectiveness across a wide temporal range.
