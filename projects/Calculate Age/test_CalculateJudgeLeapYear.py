### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical common year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_common_year
  Description: Ensures the function accurately identifies a common year, which is not a leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to recognize most years that are not divisible by 4, which are common years. It's essential for maintaining accurate yearly calculations that do not account for an extra day in February.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_common_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, such as 1900, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This distinction is vital for applications that span multiple centuries and require precise date management.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Confirms that the function identifies century years that are leap years, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly applies the leap year rule to century years divisible by 400. It's crucial for accurate date and time management over long periods.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function can accurately predict future leap years, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function remains reliable as time progresses, essential for planning and scheduling applications far into the future.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future common year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_common_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to correctly identify future common years, like 2043.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2043.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ongoing accuracy with future dates, confirming its utility in applications that require long-term date calculations without the addition of a leap day.
