### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming the function adheres to the leap year rules, ensuring accuracy in identifying leap years which are critical for date-related operations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical common year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_common_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a common year, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify the function's capability to distinguish common years from leap years, ensuring reliability in date computations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's adherence to the refined rule of leap years concerning century years, which is crucial for accurate calendar and date management over longer periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year that is a century year divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the complete set of leap year rules, especially the exception for century years divisible by 400, ensuring precision in date-related functionalities.

### Scenario 5: Test with the minimum boundary year for the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_year_1582
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1582, the first year of the Gregorian calendar implementation, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1582.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's behavior at the boundary of the Gregorian calendar's implementation, which is essential for historical data processing and educational applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a future year (e.g., 2400) that is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can accurately predict leap years far into the future, supporting long-term planning and future calendar-related functionalities.
