### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure that the function can correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 and not by 100 unless also divisible by 400. This verifies the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Important for confirming that the function does not falsely identify regular years as leap years. This helps maintain accuracy in calculations that depend on correct year classification.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the special rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. It is crucial to ensure that the function adheres to these more nuanced rules of the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies leap years that are divisible by 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the full leap year rule, including the exception for years divisible by 400. It's crucial for accurate date handling across centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Tests the function with the current year to ensure it correctly identifies whether the current year is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Compare the result with a known source or a manual calculation.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-world data ensures the function remains reliable and accurate under everyday use conditions. This scenario helps assess the function's practical utility and relevance.

### Scenario 6: Test with the smallest possible year (1 AD)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_year_one
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1 AD to see if it correctly identifies it as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's behavior at the boundary of its logical input range, ensuring it handles such edge cases correctly. This is important for historical data processing or any application requiring a broad historical range.
