### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a well-known leap year, such as 2020.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's definition of a leap year, which stipulates that a year divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400 is a leap year.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function identifies a common non-leap year correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a standard non-leap year, such as 2019.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to recognize a common year that does not meet leap year conditions, validating its compliance with the typical rules of the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Test the function with a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 1900, which is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the leap year rule excluding most century years unless divisible by 400, ensuring accurate calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Confirm the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose the year 2000, which is divisible by 100 and 400.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the exception to the century rule, where a year divisible by 400 is a leap year, critical for ensuring the function's precision in special cases.

### Scenario 5: Test the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with the year zero, which is technically a leap year by modern standards.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year 0.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 0.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.
Validation:
  Although year zero is not used in the Gregorian calendar, it is important to assess the function's behavior with edge cases like this, especially for historical or astronomical applications.

### Scenario 6: Test a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function can correctly identify future leap years, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select the year 2400, a future century leap year.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ongoing relevance and accuracy for future dates, ensuring its utility in long-term planning and calculations.

### Scenario 7: Test a negative year (before common era)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Test how the function handles years before the common era, e.g., -4 (4 BC), which should technically be a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the year -4.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with -4.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing negative years ensures the function's robustness and correctness across all possible valid inputs, accommodating historical and astronomical use cases.
