### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to recognize a common leap year, ensuring that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is correctly implemented. This is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Itâ€™s essential to confirm that the function correctly identifies typical non-leap years to prevent errors in date-related calculations, particularly in scheduling and calendaring applications.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900). Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Validating this scenario ensures that the function adheres to the extended leap year rule involving century years, which is critical for accuracy in long-term calendrical calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the special rule for century years that are divisible by 400. Ensuring this accuracy is vital for correct date handling in software dealing with a range of historical or future dates.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior with a year far in the future, such as 2400, to ensure it still applies leap year rules correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with distant future years ensures that the function remains reliable for futuristic applications, such as long-term planning tools or science fiction timelines.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_past_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's accuracy with a distant past year, such as 1700, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1700.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for historical dates is essential for applications that handle historical data, ensuring that date calculations remain consistent and accurate across a wide temporal range.
