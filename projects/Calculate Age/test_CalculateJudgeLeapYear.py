### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year (e.g., 2020) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule for leap years, ensuring its reliability in time-related calculations where leap year checks are crucial.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year (e.g., 2019) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can accurately distinguish common years from leap years, which is essential for applications relying on precise date management.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900). According to the rules, only centuries divisible by 400 are leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the full leap year rule, including the special rule for century years, which is critical for historical data processing and long-term calendrical calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly implements the exception to the century rule, supporting accurate date operations across millennium transitions.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future (e.g., 2400).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2400 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year ensures the function remains applicable and reliable as time progresses, which is essential for software dealing with long-term future planning or projections.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly evaluates the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Pass the current year to the function.
  Assert: The result should match the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function's real-time applicability, which is vital for applications that depend on current date-time data, such as schedulers or annual planners.
