### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400. The year 2020 meets the first condition, making it a leap year. This test ensures the function adheres to the defined leap year rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  The year 2019 is not divisible by 4, making it a standard year. This test checks if the function properly identifies such years, which is crucial for accuracy in applications dependent on correct year type classification.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900, to ensure it correctly applies the leap year exception rule.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Although 1900 is divisible by 4, it is not a leap year because it is divisible by 100 but not by 400. This test verifies the function's compliance with this additional rule, which is essential for correct date handling around century transitions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Checks if the function identifies a year like 2000, which is divisible by 400, as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The year 2000 is an exception to the century rule because it is divisible by 400, making it a leap year. This test ensures that the function handles these exceptions correctly, which is vital for accurate calendar and date management.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a future year like 2400, which is a leap year, checks the function's robustness and reliability in handling dates that are far beyond the typical use case, ensuring long-term functionality.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate a non-leap year far in the past, such as 1700.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1700.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Testing with a year like 1700, which is not a leap year, assesses the function's consistency over historical dates, ensuring its utility in applications involving historical data or extensive date ranges.
