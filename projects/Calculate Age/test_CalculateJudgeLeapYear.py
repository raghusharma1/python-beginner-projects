### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. Testing with 2020, which is a straightforward leap year, ensures the function handles the basic leap year calculation correctly.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Most years are not leap years. This test checks that the function correctly identifies typical years that do not meet leap year conditions.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  A year divisible by 100 but not by 400 is not a leap year, despite being divisible by 4. This test ensures that the function correctly applies this rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_divisible_by_400
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 400 as a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Years divisible by 400 are leap years even though they are also century years. This test verifies that the function correctly handles this special case in leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function is future-proof and correctly identifies leap years regardless of how far in the future increases confidence in its long-term validity.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Assesses the function's ability to correctly evaluate a non-leap year far in the past, such as 1700.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1700.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function's logic remains consistent even for years far in the past, ensuring historical accuracy in its calculations.

These scenarios cover a variety of situations, including typical cases, edge cases, and both past and future years, to comprehensively verify the correctness and robustness of the judge_leap_year function.
