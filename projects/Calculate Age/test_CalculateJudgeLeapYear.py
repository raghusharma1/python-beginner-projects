### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures the function can correctly identify a clear, uncontroversial leap year. This test verifies the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for most leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's ability to accurately reject common years that do not meet leap year conditions, thereby ensuring its reliability and accuracy in basic scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, which should not be a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function’s adherence to the full leap year rule, specifically the exception for most century years. It’s essential for ensuring the function’s compliance with complex leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_multiples_of_400_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes a year that is a multiple of 400 as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function’s ability to handle exceptions to the century rule, which is critical for correct calendar calculations over long time spans.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function can correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year ensures that the function remains accurate regardless of the year input, supporting its use in long-term planning and calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimum valid integer year
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_valid_year
  Description: Tests the function's behavior with the smallest possible integer year (1 AD).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's lower boundary condition for year input, ensuring robustness and accuracy from the beginning of the Gregorian calendar.

These scenarios cover a broad range of typical and edge cases, ensuring that the `judge_leap_year` function behaves as expected across various years and special rules. Ensuring comprehensive coverage of leap year rules is critical for any application relying on accurate date and time calculations.
