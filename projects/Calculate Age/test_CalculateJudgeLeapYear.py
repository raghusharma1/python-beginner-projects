### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures the function can correctly identify a clear, uncontroversial leap year. This test verifies the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for most leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's ability to accurately reject common years that do not meet leap year conditions, thereby ensuring its reliability in basic scenarios.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, which should not be a leap year according to leap year rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the functionâ€™s adherence to the refined rules of the Gregorian calendar regarding century years. It's essential to confirm that the function does not incorrectly classify such years as leap years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a year that is divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function recognizes a year divisible by 400 as a leap year, according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the full set of rules for determining leap years, particularly the exception for years divisible by 400. This is critical for complete accuracy in leap year determination.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's ability to correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Testing with a distant future year ensures the function remains accurate over time and confirms its utility in long-term applications, such as calendaring and planning software.

### Scenario 6: Test with the earliest year in the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_start_of_gregorian_calendar
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1582, the year the Gregorian calendar was introduced.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1582.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles the edge case of the Gregorian calendar's first year. It is essential for historical data processing and educational applications that might require accurate calendar computations starting from the very introduction of the Gregorian calendar.
