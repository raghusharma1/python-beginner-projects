### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2024.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules, where most years divisible by 4 are leap years. This is essential to ensure the function's reliability in handling dates that align with commonly understood leap year rules.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2023.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `False`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying that the function can accurately distinguish standard years from leap years, which is vital for any date-related calculations, ensuring accuracy in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify the function's ability to identify century years that are not leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's adherence to the enhanced leap year rule that centuries are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This ensures the function's accuracy over a broader range of years, reflecting more complex calendar rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly applies the exception to the century rule, where years divisible by 400 are leap years. It's essential for ensuring the function's effectiveness across all applicable scenarios, including those that occur infrequently.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_year
  Description: Ensures the function's logic holds for years well into the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with a far future year that is a valid leap year checks the function's scalability and continued accuracy with future dates, confirming its long-term usability in applications needing date computations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_past_year
  Description: Ensures the function's logic holds for historical years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1600.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can accurately process dates from historical contexts, which is crucial for applications dealing with historical data or requiring extensive date range support.
