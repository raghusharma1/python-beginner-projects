### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2024, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is implemented correctly. Ensuring the function recognizes typical leap years is fundamental to its accuracy and reliability.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year, such as 2023, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function properly identifies non-leap years, which is crucial for accuracy in applications dependent on correct date handling, such as calendaring or scheduling systems.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years (e.g., 1900) because they are not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the refined rule for leap years involving century years, which is critical for long-term calendaring applications, ensuring they do not incorrectly add a leap day in non-leap century years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies century years that are leap years (e.g., 2000) because they are divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test checks compliance with the full leap year rule including the special case for years divisible by 400. It's vital for correct date management in software dealing with historical data or planning far into the future.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verifies whether the function correctly identifies the leap status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Pass the current year to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: Manually verify if the expected result matches the leap status of the current year.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function performs correctly in real-time applications, providing a dynamic check that adapts to ongoing time changes, crucial for systems that rely on current date information.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases ensuring the `judge_leap_year` function behaves as expected across different types of years. Each test is aimed at verifying specific, crucial aspects of leap year calculation, ensuring robustness and reliability in applications that depend on accurate date handling.
