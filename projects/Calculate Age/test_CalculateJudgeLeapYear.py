### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Leap years occur every 4 years unless the year is divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. Testing with 2020 confirms the function handles the most basic leap year scenario correctly.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year. Non-leap years are years like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly identifies the common years that are not leap years, which is crucial for accurate date calculations in a real-world application.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. This test ensures that the function adheres to this rule, which is essential for correct calendar calculations over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies century years that are leap years, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to recognize the special rule for century years that are divisible by 400, thus confirming its robustness in handling exceptional date-related rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to correctly determine leap years in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates is crucial to ensure the function remains valid for future use, especially in applications requiring long-term planning and scheduling.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year close to zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_close_to_zero
  Description: Validates that the function can handle years close to 0 AD, such as the year 4, which is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 4.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's accuracy in handling very early years in the Gregorian calendar, ensuring the function's utility in historical applications or simulations.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `judge_leap_year` function is tested across a variety of typical, edge, and exceptional cases, ensuring robustness and accuracy in its ability to determine leap years.
