### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly reject common non-leap years, ensuring reliability in date-related operations where leap year identification is necessary.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a multiple of 100 but not a multiple of 400, like 1900, to ensure it is not incorrectly identified as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks compliance with the rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. It's essential for correct calendar functioning over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies a century year that is also a leap year, such as 2000, according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the correct application of the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400, which is critical for applications dealing with historical dates and long-range planning.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly identify a leap year in the future, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function's accuracy for future dates is vital for software that projects into the future, such as calendar applications and scheduling systems.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before Common Era)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Checks how the function handles years before the Common Era, such as -400, which technically should be a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with -400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's robustness in handling negative years, which is important for historical and astronomical software dealing with dates before the Common Era.
