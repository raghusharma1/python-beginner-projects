### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The year 2024 is chosen as it is a standard example of a leap year, divisible by 4 but not by 100.

### Scenario 2: Test for a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to confirm the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, fulfilling its intended use. The year 2023 serves as a straightforward example of a non-leap year.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to identify a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test by verifying that the function adheres to the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. 1900 is not, and thus should not be identified as a leap year.

### Scenario 4: Test for a leap year that is a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to confirm that the function can correctly identify special cases of leap years, such as the year 2000, which meets the criteria of being divisible by 400.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response with the current year as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the `time` module to get the current year.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Check the function's return against the expected result using `isleap`.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures the function's relevance and correct behavior in a real-time application scenario, verifying it operates correctly regardless of when it is used.

### Scenario 6: Test for the minimal boundary year (1 AD)
Details:
  TestName: test_minimal_boundary_year
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior at the boundary of the Gregorian calendar's start.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms the function's robustness and correct handling of historical edge cases, ensuring it is reliable across the full range of valid year inputs.
