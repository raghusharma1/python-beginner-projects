### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function's correctness for the standard, most common scenario.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's capability to recognize years that are not leap years under normal circumstances, aligning with the basic leap year rule excluding multiples of 100 that are not multiples of 400.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks whether the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Testing century years is crucial because they are an exception to the general rule (not a leap year unless divisible by 400). This test ensures the function adheres to the refined rules of leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is important for verifying that the function can handle the special rule for century years that are divisible by 400 and thus are leap years. It confirms the function's ability to apply the complete set of leap year rules accurately.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly identify a future leap year, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2044).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function remains accurate for future dates, maintaining its utility as time progresses and confirming its robustness across a wide range of input years.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_historic_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's accuracy for historical leap years, like 1604.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1604).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's effectiveness across a broad timeline, including historic dates, ensuring its applicability to a wide range of historical data analysis tasks.
