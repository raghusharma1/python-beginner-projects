### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule that years divisible by 4 are leap years. This is a fundamental requirement for the function to meet the expected behavior for leap year calculation.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly identify common years that are not divisible by 4. Ensuring accuracy in non-leap years is crucial for the reliability of the function in calendar-related calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's compliance with the rule that century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This scenario ensures that the function can accurately handle special cases in leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's adherence to the Gregorian rule that century years divisible by 400 are leap years. It's critical for ensuring the function's accuracy in these less frequent but significant cases.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly identify a leap year far in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with distant future years ensures that the function remains reliable over time and continues to adhere to leap year rules regardless of the year queried. This scenario helps assess the long-term usability of the function.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year in the distant past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly identify a non-leap year far in the past, such as 1800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1800.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function's logic is not only applicable to contemporary and future dates but also accurately handles years deep in the historical record. It verifies the function's comprehensive applicability across a broad temporal range.
