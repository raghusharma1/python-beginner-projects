### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are those divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to correctly identify a clear leap year scenario, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules that years divisible by 4 are leap years unless they are divisible by 100 but not 400.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the function's correctness in identifying typical non-leap years, which is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900), which is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's adherence to the leap year rule excluding most century years. This is important for maintaining accuracy across a wide range of historical and future dates.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a century year that is also a leap year (e.g., 2000), which is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.
Validation:
  The test is critical to confirm that the function can correctly handle exceptional cases in the leap year rule, specifically the inclusion of certain century years, which is vital for accurate calendrical functions spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly identify a future leap year, ensuring the function's utility remains consistent over time.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a future leap year, such as 2044.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains reliable as time progresses, supporting applications that need to plan or calculate dates in the future.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimal boundary year (1 AD)
Details:
  TestName: test_min_boundary_year
  Description: Tests the function's behavior with the year 1 AD, which is not a leap year but represents the boundary condition of the Gregorian calendar's application.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1.
  Assert: Expect the function to return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness and correctness at the boundary of its logical application, ensuring that historical dates are handled correctly.
