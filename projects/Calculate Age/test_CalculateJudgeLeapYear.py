### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year (e.g., 2020) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule for leap years, ensuring its reliability in time-related computations where leap year checks are necessary.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year (e.g., 2019) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can accurately distinguish common years from leap years, which is crucial for applications relying on precise date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900), as per the rule that only centuries divisible by 400 are leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the extended leap year rule involving century years, which is important for historical data computations and future century years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Confirms the function's ability to correctly apply the leap year exception to century years divisible by 400, which is crucial for ensuring accuracy over long-range calendar computations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function can correctly identify a leap year in the future (e.g., 2044).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a future leap year to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Assesses the function's utility in future-oriented applications, such as planning or forecasting tools, by verifying it can handle dates beyond the current year accurately.

### Scenario 6: Test with a negative year (before common era)
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_year
  Description: Tests the function's behavior with a year before the common era, such as -400 (which should be treated as a leap year).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year -400 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Validates the function's robustness and its ability to handle years in the BCE timeframe, which might be relevant for historical or astronomical applications.
