### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to recognize standard non-leap years, which is essential for any date-related operations, ensuring that non-leap years are not mistakenly treated as leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test checks the function with the year 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Ensuring that century years are correctly identified as non-leap years unless divisible by 400 is vital for maintaining accuracy in date calculations over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function identifies leap years correctly when the year is a multiple of 400, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that the function complies with the special rule of the Gregorian calendar regarding century years, which must be divisible by 400 to be considered leap years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function's ongoing relevance and accuracy, supporting applications that perform long-term planning or calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to assess leap years in the distant past, using the year 1800, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1800.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that historical date calculations are accurate, which can be crucial for applications dealing with historical data or records.

These scenarios comprehensively cover the function's ability to correctly identify leap and non-leap years under various conditions, ensuring robustness and accuracy in its implementation.
