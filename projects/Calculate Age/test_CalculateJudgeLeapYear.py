### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for standard leap years, which are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless also divisible by 400. This aligns with the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  It's crucial to verify that the function can accurately recognize standard non-leap years, ensuring it's not just defaulting to returning `True` for all inputs.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's compliance with the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. This is a critical edge case in leap year calculation.

### Scenario 4: Test a year that is divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function identifies years divisible by 400 as leap years, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly applies leap year rules for years divisible by 400, an essential validation for maintaining accuracy over long periods.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: This test checks the function's response when given the current year, which can be either a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it dynamically using the `time` module.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Manually check if the current year is a leap year and assert accordingly.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures that the function remains relevant and accurate in real-time usage, verifying its adaptability to present conditions.

### Scenario 6: Test the function with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function can correctly identify future leap years, such as the year 2040.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2040.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function can correctly evaluate future dates is critical for applications that deal with future event planning or predictions, maintaining its utility over time.

### Scenario 7: Test the function with a far past year
Details:
  TestName: test_far_past_year
  Description: This test checks the function's correctness for a year far in the past, such as the year 1600.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1600.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function handles historical data accurately, which is essential for applications dealing with historical records or data analysis spanning several centuries.
