### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year, such as the year 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year(2020)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the function can accurately identify a standard leap year, which follows the rule of being divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400. This accuracy is crucial for any application relying on correct date handling.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_non_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year, such as the year 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year(2019)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function can distinguish years that do not meet the leap year criteria, preventing errors in date computations in broader applications.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as the year 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the leap year exception rule for century years, which states that a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400. This detail is crucial for accurate date handling around century transitions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  Testing this scenario confirms that the function accurately applies the full leap year rule, including the special rule for centuries. This is vital for correct date functionality across significant historical and future dates.

### Scenario 5: Test with a far future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_far_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly identify leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year(2400)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function by extending the verification to years well beyond the typical testing range, ensuring long-term reliability of the function for future date calculations.
