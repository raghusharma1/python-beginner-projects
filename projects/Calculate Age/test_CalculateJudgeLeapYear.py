### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which state that a year divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400 is a leap year. This is critical for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify standard non-leap years, essential for any date-related functionality to ensure accuracy in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the exception to the leap year rule regarding century years, which are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This is crucial for correct date handling across century transitions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly applies the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400, critical for maintaining accurate date and time functionality over long periods, especially involving century-spanning datasets.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_year
  Description: Confirms that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far into the future.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test assesses the function's reliability over a long time frame, ensuring its utility and correctness for future-centric applications, such as long-term planning or scheduling systems.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_distant_past_year
  Description: Assesses the function's ability to accurately determine leap years in the distant past.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1600.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Testing leap year calculation for historical dates is essential for applications dealing with historical data, ensuring that the function remains accurate across all eras covered by the Gregorian calendar.
