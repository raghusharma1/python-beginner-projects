### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year, such as the year 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Rationale: Leap years occur every 4 years, unless the year is divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. 2020 is a straightforward case of a leap year divisible by 4 and not 100, making it essential to confirm the function's capability to recognize such common leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year, such as the year 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Rationale: Most years are non-leap years. This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify years that do not meet the conditions for a leap year, ensuring accurate and reliable functionality.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year like 1900, which is a century year but not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Rationale: Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test verifies the function's ability to handle the special rule concerning century years, ensuring it adheres to the correct leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function identifies a century year that is also a leap year, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test checks the function's compliance with the extended leap year rule that applies to years divisible by 400. Confirming this behavior ensures the function can accurately determine leap years in all scenarios involving century years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function can correctly identify future leap years, such as the year 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the parameter 2044.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Rationale: Testing with future leap years confirms the function's ongoing relevance and accuracy in identifying leap years, maintaining its utility as time progresses.

These scenarios comprehensively test the function `judge_leap_year` across typical and edge cases, ensuring that it functions correctly in various situations according to the rules for identifying leap years.
