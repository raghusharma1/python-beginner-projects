### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2024)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The year 2024 is chosen as it is a standard leap year, divisible by 4 but not by 100.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2023)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately identifies common non-leap years, aligning with the expected behavior when the year is not divisible by 4.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, such as 1900, to ensure it is correctly identified as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial because century years are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. This test ensures that the function adheres to this more complex rule.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_leap_century
  Description: Checks if the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 400, such as 2000, as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  Testing with the year 2000 validates that the function handles the special rule for century years correctly, ensuring accuracy for these exceptional cases.

### Scenario 5: Test with a negative year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_negative_year
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with negative years, such as -100, which technically could be treated as a leap year following the same rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(-100)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important for historical calculations that might need to determine leap years in the BCE era. Ensuring that the function can handle negative years expands its applicability and robustness.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_current_year
  Description: Ensures that the function can accurately evaluate the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using `time.localtime().tm_year`.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(current_year)`.
  Assert: Verify the result against the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function's relevance and correctness in real-time applications, such as scheduling software, which might rely on determining the current year's leap year status.
