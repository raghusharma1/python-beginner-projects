### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years; thus, 2020 is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2020)`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule for typical leap years, which is crucial for any date calculations relying on accurate identification of leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2019)`.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value is `False`.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly identifies common years that are not leap years, which is essential for accurate calendar-related operations and calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a century (e.g., 1900) which is not a leap year as it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1900)`.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the additional rule for leap years that centuries must be divisible by 400 to be a leap year. This is critical for long-term calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is also a century
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000) because it is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2000)`.
  Assert: Expect the result to be `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario checks if the function adheres to the special rule for leap years that occur every 400 years, which is vital for accurate date and time management over centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to correctly determine a leap year far in the future, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(2400)`.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function remains accurate for future dates, which is essential for applications that need to manage long-term date calculations, such as planning and scheduling software.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year far in the past, such as 1600, to verify it accurately identifies historical leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year(1600)`.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle historical data correctly, ensuring its utility in historical data analysis and applications requiring historical date accuracy.
