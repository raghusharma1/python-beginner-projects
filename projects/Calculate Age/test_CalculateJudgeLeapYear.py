### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the parameter `2024`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that leap years occur every four years; however, years divisible by 100 and not by 400 are not leap years. The year 2024 is divisible by 4 and not by 100, making it a valid leap year. The test validates that the function adheres to these rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `2023`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2023 is not divisible by 4, thus it is not a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies such years according to the defined leap year rules.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify the function identifies century years that are not leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `1900`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that although 1900 is divisible by 100, it is not divisible by 400. According to leap year rules, such years are not leap years. This test confirms that the function adheres to this more nuanced rule.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is also a divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function identifies years divisible by 400 as leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `2000`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 2000 is divisible by 400, making it a leap year despite being a century year. This test confirms that the function correctly applies the full set of leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the earliest year technically supported
Details:
  TestName: test_earliest_year_supported
  Description: Test the function with the year `1`, the earliest year technically supported by the Gregorian calendar logic in Python.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the `judge_leap_year` function with the year `1`.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the year 1 is not divisible by 4, confirming it is not a leap year. This test ensures the function can handle edge cases involving very early years.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases, ensuring that the `judge_leap_year` function behaves as expected across different types of years. Each test is designed to affirm compliance with the leap year rules as defined by the Gregorian calendar standards.
