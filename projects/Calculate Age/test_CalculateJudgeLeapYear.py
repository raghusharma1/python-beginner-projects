### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year (e.g., 2020) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule for leap years, ensuring accuracy in calculations relying on correct year type identification.

### Scenario 2: Test for a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year (e.g., 2019) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly reject common non-leap years, which is crucial for any date-related functionalities that depend on distinguishing year types.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900, which is divisible by 100 but not by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's compliance with the extended rule of the Gregorian calendar regarding century years, which is critical for correct year classification over long time spans.

### Scenario 4: Test for a divisible by 400 year
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies years that are divisible by 400 as leap years, such as the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Checks the function's adherence to the Gregorian calendar's exceptions for century years, vital for applications requiring precise date computations over centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test for future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's ability to determine leap years in the future, ensuring its utility in long-term future planning applications.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a future leap year (e.g., 2044) to the function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function remains relevant and accurate for future leap year calculations, crucial for planning and scheduling software.

### Scenario 6: Test for the smallest possible input
Details:
  TestName: test_smallest_year
  Description: Tests the function with the smallest logical input, the year 1, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Evaluates the function's robustness and accuracy when handling edge case inputs, confirming its reliability across all valid chronological inputs.

These scenarios collectively ensure that the `judge_leap_year` function operates correctly across a comprehensive range of typical, boundary, and special cases, adhering to the rules of the Gregorian calendar and fulfilling expected behaviors for leap year determination.
