### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are those divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule for leap years, which is fundamental for date calculations requiring leap year knowledge.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a common year that is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly identifies typical common years, ensuring accurate functionality for most years, which is essential for correct date handling in non-leap years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year as it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's adherence to the extended rule for leap years that excludes most century years, which is crucial for correct date handling around century transitions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is a leap year, such as 2000, since it is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly identifies special century leap years, which is important for accuracy in date calculations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year far in the future to ensure the function's logic holds for future dates.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: Check that the result is `True`.
Validation:
  Ensures the function remains reliable for future leap year calculations, supporting long-term usability of software relying on this function.

### Scenario 6: Test with the earliest year in the Gregorian calendar
Details:
  TestName: test_early_gregorian_year
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1582, the first year of the Gregorian calendar, to ensure it is handled correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1582.
  Assert: Check that the result is `False` as 1582 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly handles the edge case of the earliest year in the Gregorian calendar, ensuring historical accuracy in date-related calculations.
