### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on verifying that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This test ensures that the function can correctly identify such years.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common year that is not a leap year, like 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function can accurately distinguish years that do not meet the leap year criteria. Ensuring this functionality is vital for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is significant because it checks the function's adherence to the rule that only century years divisible by 400 are leap years. This scenario ensures that the function does not incorrectly classify all century years as leap years.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function identifies century years that are leap years, like 2000, according to the Gregorian calendar's rules.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's capability to recognize exceptions in the leap year rule specifically for century years that are divisible by 400. This is critical for maintaining accuracy in applications that handle date and time across centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's correctness for a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with distant future dates ensures that the function remains reliable over time, providing confidence in its utility for long-term usage in software solutions. This scenario also assesses the functionâ€™s adherence to the leap year calculation for future century years.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimum boundary year (1)
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_boundary_year
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior at the edge case of the smallest valid year input, which is 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling edge cases at the lower boundary of input values. It ensures that the function behaves correctly at the start of the Gregorian calendar, supporting its use in historical data contexts.
