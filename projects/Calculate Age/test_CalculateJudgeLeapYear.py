### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2020.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function behaves as expected for leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, adhering to the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2019.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately identifies years that do not meet the leap year criteria, which is crucial for correct date handling in applications.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year which is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's adherence to the leap year rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years, ensuring the function's correctness over a wide range of inputs.

### Scenario 4: Test a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Century years that are divisible by 400 are leap years, and this test ensures that the function correctly implements this less common scenario, which is critical for accurate date calculations in long-term applications.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies whether the current year is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by fetching it dynamically using the `time` module.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Manually determine if the current year is a leap year and expect the function to return the corresponding boolean value.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-time data ensures the function's reliability under real-world conditions, adapting correctly as years change.

These scenarios cover a comprehensive range of possibilities for the `judge_leap_year` function, ensuring its accuracy and reliability in different situations and over various year ranges.
