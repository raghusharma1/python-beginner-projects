### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which state that a year divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400 is a leap year. This is critical for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify standard non-leap years, essential for any date-related functionality to ensure accuracy in calculations and data consistency.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function accurately identifies century years that are not leap years (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the leap year rule excluding most century years unless divisible by 400. This is crucial for maintaining chronological accuracy over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function recognizes century years that are actually leap years (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function properly applies the exception to the leap year rule for century years divisible by 400, which is vital for accurate date and time processing in software dealing with extensive historical or future date ranges.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_year
  Description: Tests the function's ability to correctly evaluate a leap year far in the future (e.g., 2400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function remains accurate for future dates, ensuring the software's longevity and reliability in long-term planning and scheduling applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_past_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly evaluates a leap year far in the past (e.g., 1600).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1600.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's effectiveness across a wide historical range, which is essential for applications involving historical data analysis or date calculations spanning several centuries.
