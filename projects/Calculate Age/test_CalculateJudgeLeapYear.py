### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years divisible by 4.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, confirming its reliability and accuracy in handling the most common scenario.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the extended rule of the Gregorian calendar that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. It's important for ensuring accuracy over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Tests the function with a leap century year (e.g., 2000) which is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies the special case of century leap years, which is crucial for applications dependent on precise date calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies the function's behavior with a year far in the future, such as 2400, which is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2400).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function remains valid for future use, maintaining its utility in long-term applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Evaluates the function's behavior with a year far in the past, such as 1700, which is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1700).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy with historical dates, which is essential for applications dealing with historical data or long-range data analysis.
