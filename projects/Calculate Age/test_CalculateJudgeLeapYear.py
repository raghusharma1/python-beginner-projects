### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test is important because it ensures that the function meets the basic requirement of recognizing typical leap years, which are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400. This is crucial for ensuring accurate date-related calculations in applications relying on this function.

### Scenario 2: Test for a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with a known non-leap year, such as 2023.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Validating the function's ability to correctly identify non-leap years is essential for applications that depend on accurate date handling. This test ensures that the function adheres to the expected behavior for most years.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `False`.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This scenario tests the function's adherence to this rule, which is critical for maintaining accurate calendar calculations, particularly for historical data and long-term planning.

### Scenario 4: Test for a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly identifies leap years that are multiples of 400, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `True`.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying the function's compliance with the leap year rule involving multiples of 400. It ensures the function can accurately handle special cases that occur once every four centuries, which is vital for correct date management in both historical and futuristic contexts.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: This test checks how the function handles dynamically obtained years, such as the current year from the system's clock.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the `time` module to obtain the current year.
  Act: Call the function `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Manually verify if the current year is a leap year and ensure the function's output matches the expected result.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-time data ensures the function's robustness in real-world scenarios. It is crucial for applications that rely on real-time date calculations, ensuring that the function behaves as expected without hardcoded values.
