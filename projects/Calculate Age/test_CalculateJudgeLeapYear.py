### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: The expected result is True, indicating that 2020 is a leap year.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to recognize standard leap years, ensuring compliance with the Gregorian calendar rules. It is crucial for applications relying on accurate date-time calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: The expected result is False, showing that 2019 is not a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing with non-leap years confirms the function's ability to correctly apply leap year rules, which is essential for any date-related operations, ensuring the system handles regular years accurately.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_non_leap_century_year
  Description: This test examines the function's response to a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: The expected result is False since 1900, although divisible by 100, is not divisible by 400.
Validation:
  Century years that are not leap years are a special case in the leap year rule. This test ensures that the function adheres to this nuanced part of the rule, critical for accurate calendar calculations.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_leap_century_year
  Description: This test ensures the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: The expected result is True, as 2000 is divisible by both 100 and 400.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the full set of leap year rules, including the special rule for century years divisible by 400. It's crucial for maintaining accurate historical and future date calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_leap_year
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly predict a future leap year (e.g., 2044).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2044.
  Assert: The expected result is True, confirming that 2044 will be a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing with future leap years ensures that the function remains relevant and functional as time progresses, supporting applications that need to work with future dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_ancient_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies the function's correctness with a year far in the past (e.g., 800).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call the function with the year 800.
  Assert: The expected result is True since the year 800 is divisible by 400.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle calculations for years that are significantly older, which can be important for historical data analysis or applications dealing with a wide range of historical dates.
