### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2020.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in verifying the function's ability to correctly identify common leap years, which is essential for any date-related computations that rely on accurate day counts.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year, which is not divisible by 4.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2019.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function excludes common non-leap years, preventing miscalculations in date-related operations that depend on knowing the correct number of days in a year.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function identifies century years that are not leap years (i.e., not divisible by 400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 1900.
  Assert: Expect the function to return False.
Validation:
  Testing with century years ensures the function adheres to the nuanced rule of leap years that excludes most century years unless they are divisible by 400. This is vital for accurate calendar computations over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_leap_century_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a leap year when the year is a century and divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2000.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  This scenario is important for confirming that the function recognizes the exception to the century rule, which is critical for precise date calculations, especially in software dealing with historical data.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_with_future_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future, testing its reliability over an extended range.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 2400.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True.
Validation:
  Validating the function's accuracy for future dates ensures long-term utility of the software, particularly for applications in planning and forecasting that may span several centuries.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_with_past_year
  Description: Verify the function's correctness for historical years, ensuring it handles years well before the current era accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the function with the year 800.
  Assert: Expect the function to return True (since 800 is divisible by 400).
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function is reliable for historical data analysis, which may be relevant for academic or genealogical research.
