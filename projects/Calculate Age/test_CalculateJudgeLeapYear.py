### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that years divisible by 4 are typically leap years. Correct identification of leap years is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly identify regular years that do not meet leap year criteria. Accuracy in non-leap years is vital for any date-related functionality, ensuring correct calculations across years.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Century years are only leap years if divisible by 400. This test confirms that the function correctly implements this exception to the normal leap year rule, which is critical for maintaining long-term calendar accuracy.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's compliance with the rule that century years divisible by 400 are leap years. It's important for the accuracy of date calculations over extensive periods, affecting everything from historical data analysis to future planning.

### Scenario 5: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Confirms that the function can correctly identify a leap year in the future, such as 2044.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2044.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures that the function remains reliable as time progresses, essential for applications that plan or forecast based on date calculations.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_distant_past_year
  Description: Verifies the function's accuracy with a year far in the past, such as 1600.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1600.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's reliability across a wide range of years, confirming its utility in historical data processing and other applications requiring long-term chronological accuracy.
