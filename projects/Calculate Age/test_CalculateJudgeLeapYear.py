### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2020, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which is crucial for any applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known non-leap year, such as 2019, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can accurately identify common years that are not leap years, maintaining the integrity of date-related computations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year that is not a leap year, like 1900. A year divisible by 100 but not by 400 is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies that the function correctly applies the special rule for century years, which is critical for applications that span multiple centuries.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function recognizes a century year that is a leap year, such as the year 2000. This year is divisible by both 100 and 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to correctly apply leap year rules to century years, confirming its reliability over a long temporal range.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year at the boundary of leap year definition
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with the year 2004, which is exactly divisible by 4 and marks the boundary of typical leap year definitions.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2004 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles boundary conditions within the leap year rules, which is essential for precise date and time management in software applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Validates the function's ability to correctly predict leap years in the future, using a year like 2080.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2080 to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's forward compatibility and accuracy in leap year computation, ensuring its utility for future planning and scheduling applications.
