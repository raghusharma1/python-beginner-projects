### Scenario 1: Test for a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years that are divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400. This scenario confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules regarding leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test for a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies common non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Testing with a typical non-leap year helps ensure that the function correctly applies leap year rules, rejecting years that do not meet the criteria. This is vital for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test for a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year that is a century and not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Century years are not leap years unless they are divisible by 400. This test verifies that the function correctly implements this exception to the leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test for a leap year that is also a century
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Checks the function's response to a year that is both a century and a leap year, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly identifies the special case of centuries that are leap years, which is critical for any date calculations spanning multiple centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Evaluates whether the function accurately assesses the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it from the system clock.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Manually verify if the current year is a leap year and check the function's return against this.
Validation:
  This test is useful for ensuring the function's ongoing relevance and accuracy as time progresses. It helps verify that the function performs correctly in real-time applications.

### Scenario 6: Test for the year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_year_zero
  Description: Tests the function with the year 0, which is technically a leap year in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 0 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the extended Gregorian calendar rules, which might be important for historical calculations or software dealing with a wide range of dates.
