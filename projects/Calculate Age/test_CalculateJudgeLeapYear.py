### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. The correctness of this functionality is essential for any feature relying on date calculations, such as annual reports or scheduling applications.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  Testing non-leap years is as important as testing leap years to ensure the function properly differentiates between them. This scenario ensures the function's reliability across a typical use case.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validate that the function correctly identifies century years that are not leap years, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. Ensuring accuracy for such edge cases is crucial for historical data analysis and applications involving longer timelines.

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, like 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests another critical edge case of the leap year rule, ensuring that the function can handle exceptional rules in the Gregorian calendar. This is vital for correctness in applications that deal with a span of centuries.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is future-proof and can handle years well beyond the current date, which is essential for planning and forecasting applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with the current year if it is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Checks if the current year is correctly identified as a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year from the system's date.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Check against the expected outcome based on the current year's leap status.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function performs correctly in real-time and is relevant to applications that must handle real-time date calculations accurately.
