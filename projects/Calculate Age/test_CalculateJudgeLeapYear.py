### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2020 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function adheres to the basic leap year rule, which states that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year. This ensures the function's reliability in typical use cases.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2019 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to correctly identify common non-leap years, which is crucial for accurate date and calendar-related operations in applications.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1900 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the function's handling of the special rule that century years must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. Ensuring this rule is respected is vital for correct date handling around century transitions.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a multiple of 400
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_multiple_of_400
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a leap year that is a multiple of 400, like the year 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2000 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function’s compliance with the leap year rule for years that are multiples of 400, confirming its accuracy in special cases which are critical for correct calendrical calculations every 400 years.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a future leap year, such as 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 2400 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  Testing with a future year ensures the function's continued relevance and correctness in future scenarios, affirming its utility in long-term applications involving future dates.

### Scenario 6: Test with a year far in the past
Details:
  TestName: test_past_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function’s correctness with a past non-leap year, such as 1800.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with 1800 as the parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately handles historical data, which is essential for applications dealing with historical records and events that require date calculations.
