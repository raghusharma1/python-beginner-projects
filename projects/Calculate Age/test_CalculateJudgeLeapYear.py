### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, like 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2020).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function can accurately identify leap years, which is its primary purpose. This test confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for leap years divisible by 4.

### Scenario 2: Test with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that the function correctly identifies a typical non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2019).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to correctly reject non-leap years, confirming its reliability and accuracy in handling the most common scenario.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests the function with a century year (e.g., 1900) that is not a leap year because it is not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the leap year rule for century years. It's important because it verifies the function's ability to handle exceptions in the leap year rule (divisibility by 400).

### Scenario 4: Test with a century leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies a century year that is a leap year (e.g., 2000) because it is divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  The correct identification of century leap years is essential for accuracy in applications dependent on precise date calculations. This test ensures that the function can handle special cases in leap year identification.

### Scenario 5: Test with a year far in the future
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: Verifies that the function can correctly evaluate leap years far in the future, such as the year 2400.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2400).
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing with future dates ensures the function remains valid for future use, supporting long-term usability and reliability in dynamic applications.

### Scenario 6: Test with the minimum valid integer year
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_valid_year
  Description: Tests the function with the year 1, which is technically the minimum valid year in many systems.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1).
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function operates correctly at the boundary of its input range, reinforcing its robustness and reliability in handling edge cases.
