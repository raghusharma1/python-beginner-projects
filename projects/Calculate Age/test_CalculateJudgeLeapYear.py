### Scenario 1: Test with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year. Leap years are every four years, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass a known leap year, such as 2020, to the `judge_leap_year` function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the basic leap year rule (divisible by 4) is implemented correctly. Ensuring the function recognizes typical leap years is fundamental to its accuracy and reliability.

### Scenario 2: Test with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function accurately identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke `judge_leap_year` with a year like 2019, which is not a leap year.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the function does not incorrectly identify common years as leap years. Accurate differentiation between leap and non-leap years is crucial for the function's utility in date handling and calendar calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks the function's ability to recognize century years that are not leap years (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 1900 to the function.
  Assert: The result should be `False` since 1900, despite being divisible by 100, is not divisible by 400.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the correct implementation of the exception to the leap year rule concerning century years. It's crucial for ensuring the function's precision in more complex leap year scenarios.

### Scenario 4: Test with a leap year that is a century
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function identifies leap years that are century years, provided they are divisible by 400 (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Pass the year 2000 to the function.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the complete set of leap year rules, including the special rule for centuries. Validating this behavior is crucial for applications requiring accurate handling of special calendar cases.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verifies whether the function correctly identifies the leap year status of the current year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `time.localtime().tm_year` to get the current year.
  Act: Pass the current year to `judge_leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return `True` or `False` based on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  Testing with dynamic, real-time data like the current year ensures the function's reliability under typical use conditions. It also helps in confirming the function's ongoing relevance and accuracy as time progresses.

Each of these scenarios helps to ensure that `judge_leap_year` works correctly across a variety of cases, adhering to both the typical and exceptional rules that govern leap years.
