### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a known leap year, such as 2024.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that the function adheres to leap year rules, specifically that a year divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400 is a leap year.

### Scenario 2: Test a typical common year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_common_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a typical common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a known common year, such as 2023.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that the function correctly identifies years that are not leap years, ensuring accurate calendar calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test the year divisible by 100 but not 400
Details:
  TestName: test_century_not_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400 as a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function adheres to the additional rule that centuries are not leap years unless divisible by 400, which is crucial for correct calendar alignment over long periods.

### Scenario 4: Test the year divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_divisible_by_400_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a year that is divisible by 400 as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming the function's compliance with the complete set of leap year rules, ensuring accuracy in date-related computations, especially for significant calendar events.

### Scenario 5: Test the lower boundary near the Gregorian reform
Details:
  TestName: test_year_at_gregorian_boundary
  Description: This test checks the function's response to a year close to the start of the Gregorian calendar, such as 1583.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1583.
  Assert: The function should return `False`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by verifying the function's effectiveness across the full range of years where the Gregorian calendar rules apply, ensuring historical accuracy.

### Scenario 6: Test a future leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_future_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies a future leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with a future leap year, such as 2400.
  Assert: The function should return `True`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that the function can accurately predict leap years far into the future, ensuring its utility for long-term planning and scheduling applications.
