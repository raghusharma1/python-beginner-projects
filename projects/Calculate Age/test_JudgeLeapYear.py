### Scenario 1: Testing with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it validates that the function adheres to the rule that years divisible by 4 are generally leap years. This is a fundamental aspect of leap year calculation, aligning with the Gregorian calendar rules.

### Scenario 2: Testing with a typical non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a common non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2021.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function properly identifies common years that do not meet leap year criteria. Verifying non-leap years is as important as verifying leap years to ensure the function's reliability across a range of inputs.

### Scenario 3: Testing with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year (e.g., 1900).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's adherence to the additional rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. It is essential for ensuring the function's accuracy with exceptional calendar rules.

### Scenario 4: Testing with a century year that is a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a century leap year (e.g., 2000).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the exception to the century rule, ensuring that the function correctly identifies century years divisible by 400 as leap years. This test is essential for validating the function's comprehensive adherence to leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Testing with a year well before the Gregorian calendar reform
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_pre_gregorian_year
  Description: Tests how the function deals with a year before the Gregorian calendar reform (e.g., 1581).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 1581.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the appropriate value based on pre-Gregorian rules.
Validation:
  Although the Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582, testing with earlier years can be insightful to understand how the function handles historical data, especially if historical accuracy or extended calendar support is a requirement.

### Scenario 6: Testing with a future year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_future_year
  Description: Tests the function with a year far in the future to ensure it remains accurate with future dates (e.g., 2400).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2400.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function continues to operate correctly far into the future, maintaining its utility in long-term applications and future-proofing the software.
