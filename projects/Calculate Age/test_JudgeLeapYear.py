### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year, such as 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required for this test.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test, it ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rule that a year divisible by 4 is a leap year, which is a fundamental aspect of determining leap years.

### Scenario 2: Test a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function accurately identifies a common year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly reject a common year, ensuring it handles the most basic scenario of a year that is not divisible by 4, which is crucial for accurate calendar calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Test that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup needed.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks the function's compliance with the additional rule that, although a year may be divisible by 4, it is not a leap year if it is a century year not divisible by 400. This ensures the function's reliability in handling exceptions to the general leap year rule.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Testing leap years that are century years is critical because they are exceptions to the typical rule that century years are not leap years unless divisible by 400. This test confirms that the function handles these exceptions accurately, which is essential for correct date management in software dealing with historical or future date calculations.

### Scenario 5: Test the function with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_current_year_leap_status
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies whether the current year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use `time.localtime().tm_year` to get the current year.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: The function should return True or False depending on whether the current year is a leap year.
Validation:
  It's important to confirm that the function operates correctly in the context of the present day, ensuring its utility in real-time applications or systems that rely on current date data. This test helps in verifying the function's relevance and accuracy in ongoing operations.
