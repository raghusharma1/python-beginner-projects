### Scenario 1: Test a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies a typical leap year, such as 2020.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required for this test.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2020.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for leap years, which state that a year divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400, is a leap year. This test confirms the function's ability to correctly evaluate these conditions.

### Scenario 2: Test a common non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_common_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function identifies a common non-leap year, such as 2019.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2019.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function properly recognizes years that do not meet the leap year criteria. By verifying a typical non-leap year, we ensure that the function's logic correctly handles the most common scenario.

### Scenario 3: Test a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Validate that the function correctly identifies a century year that is not a leap year, such as 1900.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup needed.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 1900.
  Assert: The function should return False.
Validation:
  Testing century years is essential because they are an exception in the leap year rule. A year divisible by 100 but not by 400 is not a leap year. This test checks the function's ability to handle exceptions in leap year rules.

### Scenario 4: Test a leap year that is also a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Test that the function correctly identifies a leap year that is also a century year, such as 2000.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the year 2000.
  Assert: The function should return True.
Validation:
  This test is critical because it verifies the function's compliance with the full range of conditions for identifying leap years, specifically the rule that centuries must be divisible by 400 to be leap years. This ensures the function correctly applies all aspects of the leap year rules.

### Scenario 5: Test with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_with_current_year
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with the current year, whether it is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the current year by retrieving it from the system's date.
  Act: Call `judge_leap_year` with the current year.
  Assert: Manually verify and assert whether the current year is a leap year and match the function's output.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's relevance and correctness in a real-world scenario by using dynamic, real-time data. It also helps in validating the function's continuous functionality without hardcoding specific years.
