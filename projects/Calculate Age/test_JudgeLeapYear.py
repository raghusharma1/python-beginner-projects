### Scenario 1: Testing with a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_typical_leap_year
  Description: Tests whether the function correctly identifies a typical leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2024.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test is crucial because it checks the function's ability to correctly identify a standard leap year, which is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Ensuring accurate identification of leap years is essential for applications relying on date calculations.

### Scenario 2: Testing with a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_century_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures the function correctly identifies a common misconception year (e.g., 1900) that is divisible by 100 and not by 400 as a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 1900.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's adherence to the leap year rule that excludes most century years unless they are divisible by 400. This precision is necessary for correct date handling across century transitions.

### Scenario 3: Testing with a year that is divisible by 400
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_divisible_by_400
  Description: Tests the function with a year like 2000 that is divisible by 400 to ensure it's correctly identified as a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2000.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly handles the special case of century years that are leap years, which is vital for accurate date and time management in long-term calculations.

### Scenario 4: Testing with a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_non_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function accurately identifies a regular non-leap year (e.g., 2019).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 2019.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False.
Validation:
  It's important to verify that the function can distinguish common non-leap years, ensuring reliability in everyday date-related operations and calculations.

### Scenario 5: Testing with the current year
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_current_year
  Description: Validates the function's response when provided with the current year, checking dynamic response based on the running year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Calculate the current year using the time library.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the current year.
  Assert: Check that the function's return matches the expected leap year status of the current year.
Validation:
  Testing with the current year ensures that the function remains relevant and provides accurate outputs in real-time applications, adapting correctly as years change.

### Scenario 6: Testing with edge case year zero
Details:
  TestName: test_judge_leap_year_with_year_zero
  Description: Evaluates how the function handles the year zero, which is technically a leap year but often an edge case in date calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year with the year 0.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling unusual or boundary input values, ensuring comprehensive coverage and preventing errors in historical or theoretical date computations.
