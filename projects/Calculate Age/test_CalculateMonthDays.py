### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month values 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, with `leap_year` as either `True` or `False`.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31 for each invocation.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's allocation of 31 days to specific months, which is a standard timekeeping practice.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month values 4, 6, 9, and 11, with `leap_year` as either `True` or `False`.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 30 for each invocation.
Validation:
  This test checks compliance with the Gregorian calendar's specification for months that are designated to have 30 days, ensuring accurate calendar calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month value 2 and `leap_year` as `True`.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  The test confirms the functionâ€™s ability to correctly handle leap year calculations, which are crucial for date and time functionalities in many applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month value 2 and `leap_year` as `False`.
  Assert: Validate that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately reflects standard calendar rules for non-leap years, thus maintaining correct date and time records.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify how the function behaves when called with a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value of 0, with `leap_year` as either `True` or `False`.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling mechanism, such as an exception or a specific return value indicating an error.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling erroneous inputs that do not correspond to valid month values, ensuring the function's reliability.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify how the function behaves when called with a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value of 13, with `leap_year` as either `True` or `False`.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling mechanism, such as an exception or a specific return value indicating an error.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function can gracefully handle input values that are outside the expected range, thus preventing potential errors in larger systems where this function might be employed.
