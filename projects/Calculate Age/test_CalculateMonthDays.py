### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standard for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, each having 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test non-leap year February
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's correct implementation for standard February behavior in non-leap years, aligning with common calendrical rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test leap year February
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial for ensuring the function's accuracy in handling the special case of February in leap years, providing the correct day count as per leap year rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when given a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0 and any value for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should ideally raise an error or return a specific indication of invalid input.
Validation:
  Testing with invalid month values ensures the function's robustness and its ability to handle or report erroneous inputs effectively.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Check the function's response to a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13 and any value for leap_year.
  Assert: Expect an error or a clear indication that the input is invalid.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's error handling capabilities for month values outside the valid range, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing logical errors in larger systems.

These scenarios collectively ensure that `month_days` functions as intended across typical and edge cases, adhering to expected calendrical norms and providing robust error handling.
