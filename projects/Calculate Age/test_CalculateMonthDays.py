### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The expected result is 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming its accuracy in returning 30 days for these months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify the function's ability to correctly calculate the days in February during a leap year, aligning with the leap year rule in the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Test to ensure that the function returns 28 days for February in non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Critical for confirming the function's correctness in normal years where February has 28 days, vital for applications dependent on accurate date calculations.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensure the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month number outside the valid range (e.g., 13).
  Assert: The function should either return None or an appropriate error message/exception.
Validation:
  Important to ensure the function's robustness and error handling capabilities, preventing unexpected behavior in case of incorrect input.

#### Scenario 6: Test edge case months
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_months
  Description: Verify correct days returned for edge months like December and January.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Test with December (12) and January (1) to check respective days.
  Assert: Confirm that December returns 31 and January returns 31.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy and reliability across year boundaries, critical for applications processing date ranges spanning multiple years.

These scenarios cover the primary use cases and edge cases for the `month_days` function, ensuring comprehensive testing of its functionality according to the Gregorian calendar rules. Each test is designed to validate a specific aspect of the business logic, ensuring the function behaves as expected under various conditions.
