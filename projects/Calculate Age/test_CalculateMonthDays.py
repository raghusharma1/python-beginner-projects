```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) return 31 irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a month from the list of months that have 31 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days. This validation is crucial as it directly tests if the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 for months with 30 days (April, June, September, November).
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a month that traditionally has 30 days.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the chosen month and any leap year value.
  Assert: The expected result is 30.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms that the function accurately reflects the standard calendar months with 30 days, aligning with typical calendar structure.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to True.
  Act: Call month_days with month as 2 (February) and leap_year as True.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns 29.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly calculate the days in February for a leap year, which is essential for accuracy in date-related calculations in leap years.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to False.
  Act: Call month_days with month as 2 (February) and leap_year as False.
  Assert: Check if the result is 28.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with common calendar rules for February in non-leap years, ensuring the function is reliable for temporal calculations across all years.

Scenario 5: Test with an invalid month number (less than 1)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_below
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the month number is less than 1 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative or zero month number.
  Act: Call month_days with this invalid month number and any leap year value.
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific behavior (depending on how the function should handle such cases).
Validation:
  Ensures robustness of the function by managing incorrect inputs that fall outside the typical range of month numbers.

Scenario 6: Test with an invalid month number (greater than 12)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_above
  Description: Check the function's behavior when the month number provided is greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to a number greater than 12.
  Act: Call month_days with this invalid month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific behavior (as defined by the function's error handling).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle user errors or unexpected inputs gracefully, which is crucial for maintaining stability and reliability in software that manages date-related data.
