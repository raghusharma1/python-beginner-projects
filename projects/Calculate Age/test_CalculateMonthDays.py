### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months such as April, June, September, and November, which consistently have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 29 days when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's ability to correctly handle leap years, an essential aspect of temporal calculations in many systems.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 28 days when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the function's correctness in standard years where February has 28 days, vital for accurate date-related operations in non-leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Assert: Check that the function returns `None` or raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness by checking the function's error handling capabilities when faced with invalid input, preventing undefined behaviors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test boundary months
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_months
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the boundary cases of the lowest and highest valid months (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with months 1 and 12.
  Assert: Check that January returns 31 days and December returns 31 days.
Validation:
  Testing boundary conditions ensures that off-by-one errors and similar issues are not present, critical for reliable date handling in applications.

Each test scenario is designed to validate the correctness and robustness of the `month_days` function according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar and common expectations for handling erroneous input.
