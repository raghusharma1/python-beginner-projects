### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify function returns correct days for January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 31 days for January, which is expected for the 1st month.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(1, leap_year=False)`
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly handles the case for January, which should always have 31 days irrespective of whether the year is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Verify function returns correct days for April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 30 days for April, which is expected for the 4th month.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(4, leap_year=False)`
  Assert: Check if the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately calculates the number of days in April, which should consistently be 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Verify correct days for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Tests that February has 29 days in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(2, leap_year=True)`
  Assert: Check if the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the leap year condition, ensuring that the function correctly recognizes and adjusts for leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Verify correct days for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Tests that February has 28 days in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(2, leap_year=False)`
  Assert: Check if the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function appropriately handles the non-leap year condition for February, which is fundamental to its accuracy and reliability.

#### Scenario 5: Verify correct days for December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 31 days for December, which is expected for the 12th month.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(12, leap_year=False)`
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test verifies that December is correctly handled, which should always have 31 days regardless of leap year status.

#### Scenario 6: Verify function handles invalid month values gracefully
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month
  Description: Ensures that the function handles invalid month inputs, such as 0 or 13, gracefully. The expected behavior in this case needs to be defined, e.g., raising an error or returning `None`.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(13, leap_year=False)` and `month_days(0, leap_year=True)`
  Assert: Check if an appropriate exception is raised or `None` is returned.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the function against invalid inputs, ensuring that it fails safely without producing misleading or incorrect results.

Each of these scenarios verifies a specific and critical aspect of the `month_days` function, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both expected and edge cases.
