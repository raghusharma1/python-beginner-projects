### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 31 days for January regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the month as 1 and select any leap year status (True or False).
  Act: Call the `month_days` function with month=1 and leap_year as defined.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  The outcome ensures that the function correctly identifies January as a 31-day month, which aligns with standard Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test checks that April is correctly identified as a 30-day month.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to 4 and leap_year can be any value.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with month=4 and any leap_year value.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function adheres to the correct number of days in April, confirming accurate month-specific logic implementation.

#### Scenario 3: Verify days in February during a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_common_year
  Description: Ensure that February is reported as having 28 days during a common (non-leap) year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 and leap_year to False.
  Act: Execute `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Assert the result is 28.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's capability to differentiate between leap and common years, specifically for February.

#### Scenario 4: Verify days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February is reported as having 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 and leap_year to True.
  Act: Execute `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Assert the result is 29.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy in leap year calculation and its impact on February, which is central to correct calendar management.

#### Scenario 5: Verify days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Test to confirm that December is recognized as a 31-day month.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 12 and leap_year can be either True or False.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=12 and any leap_year value.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function correctly identifies December with its proper number of days, adhering to calendar norms.

#### Scenario 6: Validate response to negative month value
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_month_value
  Description: Test the function's response when provided with a negative month value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to -1 and leap_year to any value.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=-1.
  Assert: Check how the function handles an undefined month value.
Validation:
  Important to ensure that the function either handles error conditions gracefully or documents undefined behavior clearly.

#### Scenario 7: Validate response to month exceeding 12
Details:
  TestName: test_month_exceeding_12
  Description: Validate how the function behaves when the month value is greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 13 and leap_year to any value.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=13.
  Assert: Observe and verify the function's response to an out-of-range month.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness and error handling for invalid month inputs, ensuring reliability in real-world usage.
