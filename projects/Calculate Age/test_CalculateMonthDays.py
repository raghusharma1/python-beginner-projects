### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standard for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function accurately represents months like April, June, September, and November which consistently have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to correctly compute the days in February during a leap year, adhering to the leap year rule that adds an extra day to February.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in computing the standard 28 days for February in non-leap years, following normal calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Validate that the function handles an invalid month input less than 1 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle the scenario appropriately, potentially by raising an exception or returning a specific error value.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous input by ensuring that months outside the valid range (1-12) are properly handled.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Confirm that the function manages an invalid month input greater than 12 appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle the scenario appropriately, potentially by raising an exception or returning a specific error value.
Validation:
  Assesses the function's error handling capabilities to manage user or programming errors where the month provided is outside the acceptable range.

These scenarios comprehensively test the `month_days` function against both expected and edge case inputs, ensuring its reliability and correctness across different conditions.
