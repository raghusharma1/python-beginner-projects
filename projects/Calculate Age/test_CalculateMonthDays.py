### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and `leap_year` set to either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles months that are universally recognized to have 31 days, irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and `leap_year` set to either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function accurately calculates the days for months with 30 days, confirming its reliability across non-leap year related changes.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February is correctly identified as having 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional setup is necessary.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function's ability to correctly apply leap year rules, which are essential for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Test if February is correctly identified as having 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional setup is necessary.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  It's important to confirm that the function adheres to calendar rules for non-leap years, ensuring reliability and correctness in date calculations.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No additional setup is necessary.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 0, 13) and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should handle the case, potentially returning `None` or raising an appropriate error.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by checking the function's response to erroneous inputs, which helps prevent runtime errors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test boundary months
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_months
  Description: Ensure correct days are returned for boundary months (January and December).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` for January (1) and December (12) with `leap_year` as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both cases.
Validation:
  This test checks function behavior at the year's boundaries, ensuring consistent performance throughout the year, which is critical for applications relying on accurate date-time functionalities.
