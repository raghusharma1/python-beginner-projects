### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it does not affect these months.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year as it does not affect these months.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy for months like April, June, September, and November, which consistently have 30 days regardless of leap years.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test the function's ability to return 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with leap year rules, where February has an extra day, making it crucial for date-related calculations in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies non-leap years and assigns February the standard 28 days, which is essential for accurate date management.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Test how the function behaves when passed a month number outside the valid range (1-12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month parameter, such as 13, and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function behavior is undefined in the current implementation; this test identifies the need for error handling.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for robustness, helping to ensure the function handles erroneous inputs gracefully, potentially through raising exceptions or returning a standard error response. This is not currently implemented but is important for preventing bugs in larger systems where this function might be used.
