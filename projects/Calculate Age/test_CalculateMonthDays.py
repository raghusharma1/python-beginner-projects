```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days, regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the months which have 31 days.
  Act: Call the function month_days for each of these months with leap_year set to both True and False.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 31 for each call.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days. It is crucial for calendar-related functionalities to accurately represent days in each month for proper date handling.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the months which have 30 days.
  Act: Call the function month_days for each of these months.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 30 for each call.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function accurately reports the number of days for months that have 30 days, ensuring the function's reliability in handling these specific months.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year parameter to True.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 29.
Validation:
  This test is vital for validating the function's ability to correctly calculate the days in February during a leap year, which is essential for date calculations in such years.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year parameter to False.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 28.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves as expected during non-leap years by returning 28 days in February, which is critical for all calendar and scheduling applications.

Scenario 5: Test with an invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Act: Call month_days with the invalid month number.
  Assert: Check how the function handles the error (e.g., returns None or raises an error).
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function can handle invalid input robustly is essential for maintaining the stability and reliability of applications that depend on this function.

Scenario 6: Test with boundary month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles the boundary values of month numbers (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use the boundary month numbers 1 and 12.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 1 and 12, and leap_year both True and False.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's accuracy at the edge of its input range, which is crucial for ensuring complete functionality across all valid month inputs.
