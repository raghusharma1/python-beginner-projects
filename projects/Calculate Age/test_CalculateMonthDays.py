### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all have 31 days regardless of whether it's a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming that the function respects the standard calendar structure.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when it's a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 (February) and the leap_year parameter set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying the function's handling of leap years, ensuring that February is correctly calculated as having 29 days in such years, which is essential for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when it's not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 (February) and the leap_year parameter set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  Validates the function's logic in handling non-leap years by ensuring February is calculated with 28 days, which is vital for consistency with the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 0 or 13).
  Assert: Expect an appropriate handling mechanism, possibly an exception or a specific return value indicating an error.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness by checking the function's ability to handle incorrect inputs, which can prevent runtime errors in larger applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test boundary month values
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_values
  Description: Check the function's response to boundary month values (e.g., 1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for the months 1 (January) and 12 (December).
  Assert: Verify that January returns 31 days and December returns 31 days.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's correct response at the boundaries of valid input, ensuring no off-by-one errors or similar issues in handling typical year boundaries.
