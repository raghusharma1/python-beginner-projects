```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) return 31 irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a month from the list of months that have 31 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year status.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days. This validation is crucial as it checks the basic and most frequent scenario, covering nearly half of the cases in a yearly cycle.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) return 30 irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a month from the list of months that have 30 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year status.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies months with 30 days. Ensuring accuracy for these months is essential for applications relying on accurate date and scheduling features.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to True.
  Act: Call month_days function with month set to 2 and leap_year as True.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is critical to verify the special case of February in leap years, ensuring the function's capability to handle leap year anomalies correctly, which is vital for any date handling logic in a leap year.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to False.
  Act: Call month_days function with month set to 2 and leap_year as False.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle the most common scenario for February, ensuring it correctly calculates days for non-leap years, which is fundamental for accurate date management.

Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (negative or over 12)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully, possibly by raising an error or returning None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an invalid month number such as 0, 13, or -1.
  Act: Call month_days function with the invalid month and any leap year status.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the error as expected (either by raising an error or another means of error handling).
Validation:
  Ensuring the function can handle invalid inputs safely is crucial for robustness and preventing runtime errors in a larger application where user inputs might be unpredictable.
