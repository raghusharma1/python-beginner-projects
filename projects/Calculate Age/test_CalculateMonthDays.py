### Scenario 1: Testing with a month having 31 days in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that inherently have 31 days, regardless of whether it's a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (1, False) for January, a non-leap year.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's rules for months that always have 31 days. The result should be independent of the leap year status.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (2, True).
  Assert: Check if the function returns 29.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly adjust the number of days in February during a leap year, which is crucial for accurate date and time management in leap years.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 28 days for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (2, False).
  Assert: Check if the function returns 28.
Validation:
  This test is essential for confirming that the function adheres to the standard calendar rules by returning the correct days for February in non-leap years.

### Scenario 4: Testing with a month having 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 30 days for months that inherently have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (4, False) for April.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 30.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function correctly handles months that are designed to have 30 days according to the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 5: Invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: This test checks the functionâ€™s behavior when provided a month value below the valid range (1-12).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (0, False).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific return indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by validating how the function handles month values that are out of the expected range, which is important for error handling and data validation in software using this function.

### Scenario 6: Invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: This test examines the function's response to a month value exceeding the valid range.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (13, False).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific return indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle erroneous input gracefully, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and reliability of applications relying on accurate date management.
