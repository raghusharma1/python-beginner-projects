### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function adheres to this rule.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns February the correct number of days.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in non-leap years. This test checks that the function properly calculates the days for February in non-leap years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, regardless of whether the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days. This test confirms that the leap year parameter does not affect months with fixed day counts.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test ensures that the function correctly returns the days for December without being influenced by the leap year status.

### Scenario 6: Testing month boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify that the function handles boundary month values correctly (e.g., month 0 and month 13).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days with 0 and 13, respectively.
  Assert: The function should handle these values gracefully, possibly raising an error or returning a default value.
Validation:
  Testing boundary values ensures robustness in the function's handling of unexpected inputs. This is vital for maintaining stability and preventing crashes or undefined behavior.

### Scenario 7: Testing with a month that typically has 30 days during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_september_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for September, even in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(9, True).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  September has 30 days regardless of the leap year status. This test verifies that the leap year parameter does not incorrectly alter the day count for months unaffected by leap years.
