### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify function returns correct days for January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 31 days for January, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, leap_year)` for both leap year as True and False.
  Assert: Check that the result is 31 for both invocations.
Validation:
  January has 31 days in both leap years and non-leap years. This test validates that the function correctly identifies January and returns the appropriate number of days.

#### Scenario 2: Verify function returns correct days for April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 30 days for April in any year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, leap_year)` for both leap year as True and False.
  Assert: Check that the result is 30 for both invocations.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days, and this test ensures the function accurately reflects this consistent month length.

#### Scenario 3: Verify correct days for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that the function returns 29 days for February when it's a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test validates that the function correctly calculates the days in February during leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Verify correct days for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 28 days for February when it's not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in non-leap years. This test checks if the function properly handles the calculation for non-leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Verify correct days for December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: This test ensures that December is recognized correctly by the function as having 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(12, leap_year)` for both leap year as True and False.
  Assert: Check that the result is 31 for both invocations.
Validation:
  December has 31 days, irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not. This scenario confirms the function's accuracy for December.

#### Scenario 6: Edge case for invalid month input (e.g., month 13)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_input
  Description: Tests the function's response to an invalid month input, such as 13 or 0, which are not valid month numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(13, False)` and `month_days(0, True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the function either raises an error or returns None (depending on how function is expected to handle such cases).
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the function's robustness and its ability to handle erroneous inputs gracefully, safeguarding against potential runtime errors.
