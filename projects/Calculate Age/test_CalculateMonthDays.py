### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify function returns correct days for January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 31 days for January irrespective of the leap year flag.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(1, leap_year)` with `leap_year` as both `True` and `False`.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31 in both cases.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in confirming the consistent behavior of the function for months that always have 31 days, aligning with standard calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Verify function returns correct days for April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test ensures that April always has 30 days, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, leap_year)` with `leap_year` as both `True` and `False`.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 30 in both cases.
Validation:
  Validates that the function accurately adheres to the Gregorian calendar by returning the correct number of days for April.

#### Scenario 3: Verify function returns correct days for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_days_leap_year
  Description: Checks if the function correctly returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying the function's capability to correctly adjust February's day count during leap years, a fundamental requirement for calendar-related functions.

#### Scenario 4: Verify function returns correct days for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_days_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function returns 28 days for February in non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: Ensure that the output is 28.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function adheres to the standard calendar rules by returning the correct number of days for February in non-leap years, ensuring accuracy in non-leap year calculations.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verifies that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully, assuming the function should return `None` or raise an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(13, True)` and `month_days(0, False)`.
  Assert: Check if the function returns `None` or raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the function can handle invalid inputs is essential for robustness, preventing undefined behaviors or errors in larger systems using this function.

#### Scenario 6: Verify correct days for December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Ensures that December always has 31 days, regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days(12, leap_year)` with `leap_year` as both `True` and `False`.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is 31.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function provides consistent results for months with fixed day counts, crucial for reliability in applications relying on accurate date calculations.
