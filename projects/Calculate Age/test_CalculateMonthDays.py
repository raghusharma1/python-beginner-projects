### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standard for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, each having 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test non-leap year February
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to correctly handle the special case of February in a non-leap year, aligning with common calendar rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test leap year February
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly adjusts for leap years by providing 29 days in February, which is essential for accuracy in date-related calculations during leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Test month number boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify that the function handles unexpected month values gracefully, such as 0 or 13, which are outside the typical 1-12 range.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` first with month set to 0, and then with 13, observing any exceptions or default behavior.
  Assert: Expected behavior needs to be defined in function documentation; typically, this might throw an exception or return a default value like None.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in dealing with invalid input, ensuring the function's reliability and preventing potential errors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test typical leap year calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year_calculation
  Description: Test the function with known leap and non-leap years to ensure that it is integrating correctly with the `isleap` function from the `calendar` module.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use years 2020 (leap year) and 2019 (non-leap year) as parameters.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to the result of `isleap(year)`.
  Assert: The function should return 29 for 2020 and 28 for 2019.
Validation:
  Ensures that `month_days` function correctly interacts with the `isleap` function to determine the correct number of days in February, validating integration and correctness in leap year context.
