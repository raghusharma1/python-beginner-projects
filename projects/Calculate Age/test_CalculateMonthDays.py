### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 31 days for January regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the month as 1 and select any leap year status (True or False).
  Act: Call the `month_days` function with month=1 and leap_year as defined.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  The outcome ensures that the function correctly identifies January as a 31-day month, which aligns with standard Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test checks that April is correctly identified as a 30-day month.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to 4 and leap_year can be either True or False.
  Act: Invoke the `month_days` function with month=4 and the chosen leap_year value.
  Assert: Validate that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to correctly assign 30 days to April, adhering to the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Verify days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: Tests that February has 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Specify month as 2 and leap_year as True.
  Act: Call the `month_days` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure the result is 29.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that the function adheres to leap year rules by assigning 29 days to February, which is crucial for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 4: Verify days in February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that February has 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 and leap_year to False.
  Act: Execute the `month_days` function with these parameters.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function accurately handles non-leap years by assigning 28 days to February, crucial for calendar accuracy.

#### Scenario 5: Verify days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Checks that December is recognized as a 31-day month.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the month as 12, with leap_year as either True or False.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=12 and the chosen leap_year.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 31.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function correctly identifies December, a critical end-of-year month, as having 31 days, which is essential for year-end calculations and alignments.

#### Scenario 6: Test with the highest valid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_highest_valid_month
  Description: Ensures that the function correctly handles the highest valid month number, which is December.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 12, with leap_year as either True or False.
  Act: Execute the `month_days` function with the specified parameters.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is 31.
Validation:
  Validates that the function can handle boundary input values correctly, ensuring robustness in handling valid month inputs.

#### Scenario 7: Test with the lowest valid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_lowest_valid_month
  Description: Ensures the function correctly handles the lowest month number, which is January.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the month as 1, leap_year can be either True or False.
  Act: Call the `month_days` function with these settings.
  Assert: Confirm the result is 31.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's robustness by correctly handling the lowest boundary of valid month inputs, essential for system stability and reliability.
