### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming its accuracy in returning 30 days for these months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Assert that the outcome is 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring the function correctly calculates the days in February during leap years, a critical requirement for accurate date and time management in applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February in non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to correctly handle the usual case for February in non-leap years, ensuring that the function adheres to standard calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Check the function's behavior when provided with an invalid month number (e.g., 0, 13).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number such as 0.
  Assert: Ideally, the function should handle this gracefully, possibly raising an error or returning None.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the robustness of the function in handling erroneous input, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the application using this function.

#### Scenario 6: Test upper boundary of month input
Details:
  TestName: test_upper_boundary_month_input
  Description: Ensure the function handles the highest valid month number correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month set to 12.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly recognizes the boundary condition at the high end of valid month inputs, which is important for boundary value testing.

#### Scenario 7: Test lower boundary of month input
Details:
  TestName: test_lower_boundary_month_input
  Description: Verify correct handling of the lowest valid month number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month set to 1.
  Assert: The result should be 31.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function accurately processes the boundary condition at the low end of valid month inputs, which is essential for complete coverage in testing.
