### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 31 days for January regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define the month as January (1) and set leap_year to both True and False.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, leap_year)` for both leap and non-leap year scenarios.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 31 in both cases.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days, hence the function should consistently return 31, aligning with standard calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Verify days in February (leap year)
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that February has 29 days in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to February (2) and leap_year to True.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 29.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns February 29 days, which is crucial for accuracy in date-related calculations in leap years.

#### Scenario 3: Verify days in February (non-leap year)
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that February has 28 days in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to February (2) and leap_year to False.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 28.
Validation:
  The test is essential to confirm that the function properly handles the standard 28-day February in non-leap years, a fundamental requirement for any date-handling logic.

#### Scenario 4: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: Confirm that April has 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to April (4) and set leap_year to any value.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(4, leap_year)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is 30.
Validation:
  April should always have 30 days, and this test ensures that the function adheres to this rule, which is vital for maintaining calendar consistency.

#### Scenario 5: Validate handling of invalid month values
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_value
  Description: Checks the behavior of the function with a month value outside the valid range (1-12).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an invalid month value such as 0 or 13, and set leap_year to any value.
  Act: Attempt to call `month_days(invalid_month, leap_year)`.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the situation, preferably by raising an exception or a specific error handling mechanism.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures robustness by validating that the function can gracefully handle erroneous input, which is crucial for preventing undefined behaviors in applications using this function.

#### Scenario 6: Verify days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Ensures that December has 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to December (12) and leap_year to any value.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(12, leap_year)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  December should always have 31 days, and this test checks the function's compliance with this rule, essential for end-of-year date calculations and consistency.

These scenarios collectively ensure the function `month_days` adheres to the standard Gregorian calendar rules and handles both typical and edge cases effectively, thus supporting reliable date and time management in applications.
