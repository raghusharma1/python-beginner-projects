### Scenario 1: Correct days for months with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_months_with_31_days
  Description: This test verifies that months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) return the correct number of days regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a list of months that have 31 days.
  Act: Iterate through the list, calling the month_days function for each month, both with leap_year as True and False.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 31 for each month.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function correctly handles months that traditionally have 31 days. This is crucial for any applications depending on accurate date calculations, such as scheduling or calendaring systems.

### Scenario 2: Correct days for months with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_months_with_30_days
  Description: This test checks that months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) correctly return 30 days, independent of whether it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: List the months that typically have 30 days.
  Act: Invoke month_days for each of these months with leap_year set to both True and False.
  Assert: Ensure that each function call returns 30.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to handle months with 30 days accurately, which is essential for correct date management in various practical applications.

### Scenario 3: February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Test to ensure that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to February and leap_year to True.
  Act: Call month_days with these parameters.
  Assert: Validate that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's capability to handle the special case of February in a leap year, which is vital for accuracy in leap years.

### Scenario 4: February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the month to February and leap_year to False.
  Act: Call month_days with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 28.
Validation:
  Testing February in non-leap years is crucial as it ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar system, affecting all date-related operations in standard years.

### Scenario 5: Invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_numbers
  Description: Checks how the function behaves when passed a month number outside the standard range of 1-12.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a set of invalid month numbers such as 0, 13, -1.
  Act: Call month_days with each of these invalid numbers and any leap_year status.
  Assert: Since the function does not handle errors, this test will observe if it returns None or an incorrect value, which can be useful for identifying the need for error handling.
Validation:
  This test is important to identify how the function behaves with unexpected input and to assess the need for additional error handling, which might be crucial for robustness in a production environment.

These scenarios provide comprehensive coverage of the month_days function's behavior under various conditions, ensuring reliability and correctness in its role within larger systems or applications.
