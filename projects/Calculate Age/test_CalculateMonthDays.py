### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and `leap_year` set to either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles months that are universally recognized to have 31 days, irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and `leap_year` as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to accurately return the correct day count for months that consistently have 30 days, confirming behavior across non-leap and leap years.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 29 days when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is necessary.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's capability to handle the special case of February in leap years, aligning with leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  It's important to ensure that the function adheres to calendar rules by returning 28 days for February in non-leap years, thus maintaining accuracy in non-leap year scenarios.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify how the function behaves when given an invalid month number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the valid range (e.g., 0 or 13) and any boolean for `leap_year`.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle this gracefully, possibly by returning `None` or raising an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling erroneous input, ensuring it fails gracefully without causing unexpected behavior, which is essential for maintaining reliability in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test boundary month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_numbers
  Description: Verify the function's response to boundary month values (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Test both boundary cases by calling `month_days(1, False)` and `month_days(12, True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 31 for both cases.
Validation:
  Testing boundary conditions ensures that the function handles edge cases correctly, particularly the transition between years, which is critical for applications relying on accurate date calculations.
