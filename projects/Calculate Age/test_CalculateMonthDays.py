### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months such as April, June, September, and November, which have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, a fundamental requirement for accuracy in date-related calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle regular years correctly by ensuring February has 28 days, aligning with standard calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the month number is less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0.
  Assert: Check how the function behaves (expect an exception or a specific return value if handled).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness in dealing with erroneous input, ensuring that it either fails gracefully or handles unexpected month values correctly.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the month number is greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13.
  Assert: Check how the function behaves (expect an exception or a specific return value if handled).
Validation:
  Similar to scenario 5, this test checks the function's ability to manage incorrect input values effectively, ensuring error handling or appropriate responses to user errors.

These scenarios collectively ensure the function `month_days` adheres to both standard calendar rules and exceptional error handling, providing a robust solution for determining the number of days in a given month.
