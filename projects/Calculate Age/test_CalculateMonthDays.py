### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the argument for a month known to have 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standards for months with 31 days. Correct output validates accurate month length handling.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the argument for a month known to have 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months having 30 days, ensuring accurate month length reporting.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with February (2) and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for verifying the function's ability to correctly handle leap years, a fundamental requirement for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with February (2) and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in non-leap years for February, validating its ability to differentiate between leap and non-leap years, crucial for date-sensitive applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles a month value below the valid range (e.g., 0 or negative).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with a month value of 0.
  Assert: The function behavior is not defined for this input; expect an error or a specific return value as per design decisions.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness in handling erroneous input values, ensuring stability and reliability in real-world applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Ensure the function handles a month value above the valid range (e.g., 13 or higher).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value of 13.
  Assert: As with the previous test, expect an error or a specific return value as per design decisions.
Validation:
  Validates the function's error handling capabilities for out-of-range inputs, crucial for maintaining application integrity under erroneous conditions.
