### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which are expected to have 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming it returns 30 days as expected.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the function's ability to correctly handle leap years, a fundamental aspect of the Gregorian calendar, ensuring that February has 29 days in such years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's accuracy in regular years by returning 28 days for February, aligning with standard calendar expectations.

#### Scenario 5: Test month outside typical range
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_bound
  Description: Ensure that the function handles months less than 1 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=0 (or any negative number) and a random leap_year value.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning None or raising a specific error.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the functionâ€™s robustness in handling erroneous input, ensuring that it gracefully manages unexpected month values.

#### Scenario 6: Test month outside typical range
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_bound
  Description: Ensure that the function handles months greater than 12 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=13 (or any number greater than 12) and a random leap_year value.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning None or raising a specific error.
Validation:
  Similar to Scenario 5, this test checks the function's ability to deal with out-of-range inputs, maintaining robustness and error handling in the face of such scenarios.
