### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function adheres to this rule.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February should have 29 days in a leap year. This scenario ensures that the function correctly recognizes leap years and assigns February the correct number of days.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February should have 28 days in a non-leap year. This test confirms the function's correctness in handling standard years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April
Details:
  TestName: test_april
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days, independent of leap year considerations. This scenario ensures that the function correctly assigns 30 days to April.

### Scenario 5: Testing December
Details:
  TestName: test_december
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test confirms that the function is consistent with this rule.

### Scenario 6: Testing a month number below valid range
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_low
  Description: Verify how the function behaves with a month number below the valid range (e.g., 0).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(0, False).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific behavior (e.g., return None).
Validation:
  Testing invalid inputs ensures the function's robustness and its ability to handle unexpected values gracefully.

### Scenario 7: Testing a month number above valid range
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_high
  Description: Verify how the function behaves with a month number above the valid range (e.g., 13).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, False).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific behavior (e.g., return None).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's error handling capabilities when presented with inputs that are not within the expected range of month numbers.

### Note:
The scenarios for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are similar to Scenario 1, and scenarios for months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are similar to Scenario 4. These tests should be implemented similarly, ensuring that all months are correctly handled by the function.
