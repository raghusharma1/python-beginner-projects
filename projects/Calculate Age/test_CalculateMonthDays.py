### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns 31 days for January, irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, True)` and `month_days(1, False)`.
  Assert: Check that both calls return 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days, so the function should return 31 regardless of the leap year flag. This ensures that months with a fixed number of days are handled correctly.

#### Scenario 2: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test ensures that April, which is not affected by leap years, always has 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, True)` and `month_days(4, False)`.
  Assert: Check that both calls return 30.
Validation:
  April should always return 30 days because it does not depend on leap year calculations. This test confirms the correct handling of a non-leap affected month.

#### Scenario 3: Verify days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as February has variable days depending on leap years. Ensuring 29 days are returned in a leap year validates leap year functionality.

#### Scenario 4: Verify days in February during a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_common_year
  Description: This test checks if February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 28.
Validation:
  Since February has 28 days in non-leap years, this test confirms the function's ability to handle common years correctly.

#### Scenario 5: Verify days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Checks that December always returns 31 days, regardless of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(12, True)` and `month_days(12, False)`.
  Assert: Ensure both calls return 31.
Validation:
  December, like January, always has 31 days. This test verifies consistent handling of months unaffected by leap year variations.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensures that the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully, possibly by returning `None` or raising an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Attempt to call `month_days(13, True)` and `month_days(0, False)`.
  Assert: Check for an appropriate handling of invalid input (either through exception handling or specific return value).
Validation:
  Validates the robustness of the function in handling erroneous inputs, ensuring that the system remains stable and provides meaningful feedback for out-of-range values.

#### Scenario 7: Verify month boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Tests the boundary month values (1 and 12) to ensure they are handled correctly in both leap and common years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, True)` for January and `month_days(12, False)` for December.
  Assert: Confirm that January returns 31 and December returns 31.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's correct response at the boundary values of the input domain, ensuring no off-by-one errors in month handling.

Each of these scenarios ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the `month_days` function across typical and edge cases, focusing on its ability to return the correct number of days based on month and year type.
