### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test ensures the function correctly handles standard cases for months with fixed days.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test checks the function's ability to correctly evaluate leap years and adjust month days accordingly.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This scenario ensures that the function properly identifies non-leap years and assigns the correct number of days to February.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, irrespective of whether it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days, regardless of leap year status. This test confirms that the function maintains consistent behavior for months unaffected by leap years.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days, and this test ensures that the function consistently applies this across leap and non-leap years.

### Scenario 6: Testing with an invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully, potentially by raising an error or returning None.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, True) and month_days(0, False).
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error is raised or None is returned.
Validation:
  Validating how the function handles incorrect inputs is crucial for robustness. Since the function does not currently handle such cases, this test can guide necessary modifications or error handling improvements.
