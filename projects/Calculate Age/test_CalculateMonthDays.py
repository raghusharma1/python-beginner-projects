### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify function returns correct days for January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 31 days for January, regardless of whether the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days(1, leap_year)` for both `leap_year=True` and `leap_year=False`.
  Assert: The function should return 31 in both cases.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in confirming the function's correctness for boundary conditions, as January is the first month of the year. The expected result directly aligns with the Gregorian calendar's specifications.

#### Scenario 2: Validate function for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Validates that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is critical because February's day count changes in leap years. Ensuring accuracy here is essential for applications depending on precise date calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Validate function for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensures that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to correctly handle the most common case for February. It's crucial for maintaining the integrity of date-related operations in non-leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Verify correct days for April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: Tests if the function correctly returns 30 days for April.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, leap_year)` for both `leap_year=True` and `leap_year=False`.
  Assert: The function should return 30 in both cases.
Validation:
  April, like several other months, always has 30 days. This test confirms the function's consistency across different types of years.

#### Scenario 5: Validate handling of December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Confirms that the function returns 31 days for December, which is the last month of the year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(12, leap_year)` for both `leap_year=True` and `leap_year=False`.
  Assert: The function should return 31 in both cases.
Validation:
  Testing December ensures the function's reliability at the year's boundary. Critical for annual computations and validations.

#### Scenario 6: Test behavior with invalid month input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month
  Description: Checks how the function behaves when an invalid month (e.g., 0 or 13) is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(0, True)` and `month_days(13, False)`.
  Assert: Expect the function to either return `None` or raise an appropriate exception (behavior should be defined based on how function handles these cases).
Validation:
  This scenario ensures robustness by testing how well the function handles unexpected or erroneous inputs, which is essential for preventing runtime errors in a live environment.
