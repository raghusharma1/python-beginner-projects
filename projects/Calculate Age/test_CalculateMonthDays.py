### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it does not affect these months.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year as it does not affect these months.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months such as April, June, September, and November, which have 30 days regardless of the year.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 29 days for February in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to handle the special case of February in a leap year, ensuring it returns the correct number of days according to leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 28 days for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves correctly by returning 28 days for February in a non-leap year, adhering to the standard Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the month number is outside the valid range (1-12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning None or raising an exception.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous input, which can be common in dynamic environments. The function should either handle the error internally or inform the caller by raising an appropriate exception.

#### Scenario 6: Test borderline month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_borderline_month_numbers
  Description: Verify correct behavior at the boundaries of valid month inputs (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for both month 1 and month 12 with any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  This test checks the functionâ€™s accuracy at the boundary values of its input domain, ensuring no off-by-one errors or similar issues in month handling.
