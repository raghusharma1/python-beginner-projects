### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's standard months which have 31 days, reflecting accurate month duration.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to accurately report the number of days for months that are universally 30 days long, ensuring compliance with the standard calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's capability to determine the correct number of days in February during a leap year, which is critical for date calculations in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function correctly identifies February as having 28 days in non-leap years, aligning with common calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test leap year effect on other months
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_effect_on_other_months
  Description: Verify that the leap year status does not affect the number of days in months other than February.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` for each month other than February, with leap_year toggled between True and False.
  Assert: The returned days should match the expected days (31 or 30) regardless of the leap year status.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the leap year parameter only influences February, maintaining the integrity of the function's handling of other months.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month value (e.g., 0, 13, -1) and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, potentially by returning None or raising a specific exception.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by testing how the function manages inputs that fall outside expected month values, which is crucial for preventing runtime errors in larger applications.
