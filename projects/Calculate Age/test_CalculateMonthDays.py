### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test ensures that the function adheres to this invariant.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test checks the function's ability to correctly handle leap year logic for February.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test validates the function's accuracy for standard years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_any_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 30 days for April, regardless of leap status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True) and month_days(4, False).
  Assert: Check that both results are 30.
Validation:
  April consistently has 30 days. This test ensures that leap year status does not affect months that always have the same number of days.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_any_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, independent of whether it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, True) and month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that both results are 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test ensures consistency and correctness for months unaffected by leap years.

### Scenario 6: Testing invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensure that the function handles an invalid month input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Attempt to call month_days(13, True) or month_days(0, False).
  Assert: Check for an appropriate handling of invalid input (e.g., exception or error message).
Validation:
  The function should be robust against invalid inputs. This test checks the function's error handling capabilities for month values outside the valid range (1-12).

### Scenario 7: Testing boundary month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_numbers
  Description: Verify correct day counts for boundary months (January and December) across leap and non-leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, True), month_days(1, False), month_days(12, True), and month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that results match the expected 31 days for all cases.
Validation:
  Testing boundary values ensures that the function correctly handles the start and end of the range of valid inputs, maintaining accuracy across different year types.
