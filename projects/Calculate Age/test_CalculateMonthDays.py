### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function correctly identifies January and returns the appropriate number of days.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies February in a leap year and returns the correct number of days.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test checks that the function correctly identifies February in a non-leap year and returns the appropriate number of days.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_any_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April regardless of the leap year flag.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True) and month_days(4, False).
  Assert: Check that both results are 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days, irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies April and consistently returns 30 days.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_any_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, independent of the leap year condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, True) and month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that both results are 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days, regardless of leap year status. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies December and consistently returns 31 days.

### Scenario 6: Testing month number boundary (lower limit)
Details:
  TestName: test_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number (e.g., 0) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(0, True).
  Assert: Check how the function handles the invalid input.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling unexpected month numbers that are below the valid range (1-12). It's important to know how the function behaves under such conditions, although the function's current implementation might not explicitly handle this case.

### Scenario 7: Testing month number boundary (upper limit)
Details:
  TestName: test_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number (e.g., 13) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, False).
  Assert: Check how the function handles the invalid input.
Validation:
  This test examines the function's robustness in managing unexpected month numbers that exceed the valid range. Understanding the behavior in such scenarios is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the function.
