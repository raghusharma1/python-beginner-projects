### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with each month that should have 31 days (e.g., January, March, May, July, August, October, December).
  Assert: Check that the function returns 31 for each of these months.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's specifications for months that have 31 days, which is crucial for any application relying on accurate date calculations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with each month that should have 30 days (e.g., April, June, September, November).
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 30 for each of these months.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly handle months with 30 days, important for applications that perform operations based on monthly cycles.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month 2 and `leap_year` as True.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify the function's compliance with leap year rules, ensuring accuracy in date-related functionalities that consider February's variable day count.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month 2 and `leap_year` as False.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns 28.
Validation:
  Essential for validating the function's handling of February in common years, aligning with standard calendar expectations and ensuring accuracy in scheduling and planning applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month values
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_values
  Description: Assess the function's response to invalid month inputs such as negative values, zero, or values greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with invalid month values (e.g., 0, -1, 13).
  Assert: The function should handle these gracefully. Depending on implementation, this could mean returning None or raising an error.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with unexpected or out-of-range inputs, which is vital for maintaining stability and reliability in software that manages date information.

#### Scenario 6: Test typical leap year check
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year_check
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies typical leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with February (month 2) and a typical leap year like 2024.
  Assert: The function should return 29 days for February 2024.
Validation:
  Validates the leap year calculation within the function, ensuring that it aligns with the Gregorian calendar rules, particularly for years divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless divisible by 400.

These scenarios collectively ensure comprehensive testing of the `month_days` function, covering both normal and edge cases, thereby guaranteeing the function's reliability and accuracy in date handling.
