### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies months that have 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date and scheduling applications.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle months with 30 days, important for correct date-related operations in various applications.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules regarding February in leap years, crucial for date accuracy.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function properly calculates the days in February for non-leap years, which is essential for all calendar-related functionalities.

#### Scenario 5: Test month number boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify that the function handles unexpected month values gracefully, such as 0 or 13, which are not valid month numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` first with month set to 0 and then with month set to 13, leap_year can be any boolean.
  Assert: The function should handle these gracefully, potentially by raising an error or returning None.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by checking the function's response to invalid inputs, which helps prevent runtime errors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test different leap year values
Details:
  TestName: test_different_leap_year_values
  Description: Confirm that the function correctly handles the leap_year flag for different years, affecting February's day count.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set first to True, then to False in separate calls.
  Assert: The function should return 29 for True and 28 for False.
Validation:
  Validates that the function respects the leap year variations correctly, which is fundamental for all applications that depend on precise date calculations.
