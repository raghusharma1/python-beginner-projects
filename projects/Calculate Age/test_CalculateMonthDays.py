### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January which is month 1).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly identify and return the number of days in months that have 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date-related computations in applications.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April which is month 4).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's capability to handle months with 30 days correctly, which is important for functionalities that depend on month length.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 (February) and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, which is essential for calendar and scheduling applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Test that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 (February) and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy in computing the number of days in February for non-leap years, which is critical for date calculations in various applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when passed an invalid month number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the valid range (e.g., 13).
  Assert: Check for handling of invalid input, potentially returning None or raising an error.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function deals with erroneous input, ensuring robustness and error handling in applications using this functionality.

#### Scenario 6: Test edge case of month boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month
  Description: Test the function with boundary month numbers, like 1 (January) and 12 (December).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` separately with month parameters set to 1 and 12.
  Assert: Verify that the return values are correct for January (31 days) and December (31 days).
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function performs correctly at the boundaries of valid input, which helps in preventing off-by-one errors and ensuring data integrity in applications.
