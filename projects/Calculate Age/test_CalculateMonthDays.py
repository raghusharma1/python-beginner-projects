### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's standard months which have 31 days, reflecting accurate month duration.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to accurately report the number of days for months that are universally 30 days long, ensuring compliance with the standard calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February has 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's logic to determine if it correctly identifies and adjusts for leap years, which is crucial for date-related calculations and operations.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February has 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Validates that the function is consistent with the Gregorian calendar for non-leap years, providing correct information crucial for applications relying on accurate date data.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_numbers
  Description: Check that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with invalid month numbers such as 0, 13, or negative numbers, and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should handle the situation gracefully, potentially raising an error or returning a default value.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by verifying that the function can handle erroneous input without crashing, which is important for maintaining stability in applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test month boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify correct days count for boundary month values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for months 1 and 12 with both True and False for the leap_year parameter.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both cases.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly interprets boundary month values, which is essential for applications requiring precise date calculations at year boundaries.
