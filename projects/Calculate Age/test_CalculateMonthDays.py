```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) return 31 irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a month from the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and any leap year status.
  Act: Call month_days with the selected month and leap year status.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies months traditionally having 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date-related calculations in applications.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) return 30, independent of whether it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a month from [4, 6, 9, 11] and any leap year status.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the chosen month and leap year status.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function accurately provides the number of days for months that consistently have 30 days, which is essential for correct time-span computations and scheduling functionalities.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 and leap_year to True.
  Act: Execute month_days with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the outcome is 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to correctly adjust the number of days in February during leap years, aligning with the Gregorian calendar rules.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 and leap_year to False.
  Act: Execute month_days with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's compliance with standard calendar conventions by returning the correct number of days for February in non-leap years, which is fundamental for date management.

Scenario 5: Test with invalid month numbers (less than 1 or greater than 12)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully, potentially by raising an error or returning a specific error value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a month value outside the valid range (e.g., 0, 13).
  Act: Call month_days with this invalid month and any leap_year value.
  Assert: Check how the function handles this input, expecting an error or a special return indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by verifying that the function can handle erroneous inputs without crashing, which is crucial for maintaining stability in applications relying on this function.

Scenario 6: Test edge cases for month boundaries
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_cases_for_month_boundaries
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly returns the number of days for edge months (January and December).
Execution:
  Arrange: Test with months 1 and 12, with varying leap_year statuses.
  Act: Call month_days for both scenarios.
  Assert: Verify that January returns 31 days and December returns 31 days.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's accuracy at the boundaries of the year, which is particularly useful for applications that perform year-end calculations or date validations.
