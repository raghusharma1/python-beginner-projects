### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test ensures that the function adheres to this invariant.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test checks that the function correctly recognizes leap years and assigns February the correct number of days.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 28 days for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February should have 28 days in a non-leap year. This test verifies that the function properly calculates the days for February in standard years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, even in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 30.
Validation:
  April consistently has 30 days, irrespective of whether it's a leap year. This test ensures that leap year conditions do not affect months that always have a fixed number of days.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that December has 31 days regardless of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test ensures consistency in the function's handling of December across different years.

### Scenario 6: Testing with an invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensure the function handles an invalid month number gracefully, perhaps by returning None or raising an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, True).
  Assert: Check for an appropriate error handling response (None or exception).
Validation:
  Since the function is not designed to handle invalid month numbers, this test ensures robust error handling, which is crucial for maintaining reliability in software that interacts with this function.
