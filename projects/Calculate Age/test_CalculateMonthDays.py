```
Scenario 1: Test days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for January, which is expected for the first month.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=1 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it's a leap year or not. This test ensures the function correctly handles months with a fixed number of days.

Scenario 2: Test days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for April, which is expected for the fourth month.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=4 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days. This test checks the function's ability to handle months that consistently have the same number of days, independent of leap years.

Scenario 3: Test days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: Validate that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test verifies the function's ability to adjust the number of days based on leap year conditions.

Scenario 4: Test days in February during a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test confirms that the function correctly computes days for February under standard conditions.

Scenario 5: Test days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 31 days for December, aligning with the expected number of days for the twelfth month.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=12 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This scenario ensures that the function handles months at the end of the year correctly.

Scenario 6: Test invalid month input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_input
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when provided with a month value outside the typical range (1-12).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=13 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check for handling of invalid input, such as returning None or raising an error.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function properly handles out-of-range input is crucial for robustness, preventing undefined behaviors during runtime.
