```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) return 31 irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a month from the list of months that have 31 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to confirm the function correctly identifies months that inherently have 31 days, independent of whether the year is a leap year or not. This is crucial for accurate date and time-based operations in applications.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) return 30, regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a month from the list of months that have 30 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately recognizes months that have 30 days. This validation is essential for functionalities that depend on month length for calculations or operations.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to True.
  Act: Call month_days function with month set to 2 and leap_year as True.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function correctly handles the special case of February in leap years, which is fundamental for date handling and validation in leap years.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to False.
  Act: Call month_days function with month set to 2 and leap_year as False.
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to accurately return the correct number of days in February for non-leap years, which is crucial for all date-related operations in such years.

Scenario 5: Test invalid month values
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_values
  Description: Ensure the function handles invalid month values gracefully. Expect a default behavior or error handling mechanism.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an invalid month value (e.g., 13, 0, -1).
  Act: Call month_days function with the invalid month and any leap year status.
  Assert: Check how the function behaves - whether it throws an error, returns None, or handles it differently.
Validation:
  Testing with invalid month values checks the robustness of the function against erroneous inputs, ensuring the function's reliability in unexpected scenarios.
