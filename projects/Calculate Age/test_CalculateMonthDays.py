### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's standard months which have 31 days, irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months that have 30 days, confirming correct behavior regardless of leap year status.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to correctly identify and return the number of days in February during a leap year, aligning with leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function accurately calculates the days in February for non-leap years, which is crucial for any date-related calculations depending on this function.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Ensure the function handles months less than 1 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0 or any negative number, and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should ideally throw an error or return None.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's robustness in handling erroneous input by rejecting invalid month values that are less than 1.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Ensure the function handles months greater than 12 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13 or higher, and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should ideally throw an error or return None.
Validation:
  Tests the function's ability to effectively manage incorrect inputs by rejecting invalid month values that exceed the usual range, ensuring data integrity.

Each of these scenarios is structured to validate specific aspects of the `month_days` function against expected norms and edge cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both typical and atypical conditions.
