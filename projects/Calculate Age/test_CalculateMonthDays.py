### Scenario 1: Testing with a month having 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for months that typically have 31 days, regardless of whether it's a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, both with `leap_year` as True and False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31 for each case.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date-related operations in applications.

### Scenario 2: Testing with a month having 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters for months 4, 6, 9, and 11.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly handle months with 30 days, which is essential for accurate date and scheduling functionalities.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Check that February has 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure that the function correctly handles the unique case of February in leap years, which is critical for date calculations in such years.

### Scenario 4: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February has 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 28.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function accurately calculates the days in February for non-leap years, which is fundamental for any date-related functionality.

### Scenario 5: Testing with an invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Test the function with a month value less than 1 to see how it handles invalid input.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value of 0 and any leap year boolean.
  Assert: Expect an undefined or error response, depending on implementation.
Validation:
  Validates the function's robustness and error handling when faced with unexpected or invalid input values.

### Scenario 6: Testing with an invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Test the function with a month value greater than 12 to check its error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value of 13 and any leap year boolean.
  Assert: Expect an undefined or error response, depending on implementation.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's error handling capabilities when provided with out-of-range input, critical for maintaining application stability.
