### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all return 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function returns 30 days for April, June, September, and November validates its adherence to standard calendar rules for these months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, a fundamental requirement for accurate calendar-related calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the function correctly handles the standard scenario for February in non-leap years, ensuring reliability in non-leap year calendar calculations.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month number outside the valid range (e.g., 0 or 13).
  Assert: Check how the function behaves (e.g., returns None, raises an exception).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when confronted with invalid input, ensuring that the function is secure and stable under erroneous conditions.

#### Scenario 6: Test month boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify that the function handles boundary month values correctly (e.g., 1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 1 and 12 respectively.
  Assert: Verify that the returned values are 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  Testing boundary values is a good practice in software testing to ensure no off-by-one errors and the function performs as expected at the edges of the valid input range.
