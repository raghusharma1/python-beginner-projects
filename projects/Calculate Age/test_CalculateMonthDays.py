### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January which is month 1).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle months that are universally recognized to have 31 days, ensuring that the core functionality respects typical Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April which is month 4).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  Validates the accuracy of the function for months with 30 days, confirming its reliability and adherence to the standard calendar format.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies and calculates the days in February during a leap year, which is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  Critical for verifying the function's performance in common years, ensuring that February is correctly handled as per the Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (lower boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_lower
  Description: Test how the function behaves when passed a month number less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0.
  Assert: Check how the function handles this case, possibly expecting an error or a specific return value.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with invalid input, ensuring stability and reliability.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number (upper boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_upper
  Description: Assess the function's response to a month number greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13.
  Assert: Evaluate how the function manages this input, potentially expecting an error or a specific return value.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to deal with incorrect input values gracefully, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the application.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases, ensuring the function behaves as expected across both valid and invalid inputs while adhering to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
