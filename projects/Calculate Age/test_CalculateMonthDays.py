### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's specification for months that contain 31 days, irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11].
  Assert: Confirm the function returns 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months having 30 days, which is crucial for accurate date and time management in applications.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Identify a leap year.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Verify the output is 29.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm the function's ability to correctly handle the special case of February in leap years, ensuring date calculations are correct for such years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Identify a non-leap year.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  Essential for verifying the function's accuracy in non-leap years, crucial for applications dependent on precise date management.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (less than 1)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number_below_range
  Description: Ensure the function handles cases where the month number is less than 1 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month number less than 1.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate response or error handling.
Validation:
  Validates the function's robustness in handling erroneous input, protecting applications from potential crashes or undefined behaviors.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number (greater than 12)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number_above_range
  Description: Ensure the function handles cases where the month number is greater than 12 appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month number greater than 12.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate response or error handling.
Validation:
  Tests the function's error handling capabilities for out-of-range inputs, safeguarding applications from unexpected behaviors.

These scenarios collectively ensure that `month_days` functions correctly across all typical, edge, and error cases according to the Gregorian calendar rules, handling both valid and invalid inputs effectively. This comprehensive testing approach guarantees reliability and robustness in applications utilizing this function for date-related functionalities.
