### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months known to have 31 days. Correct day count is fundamental for date-related calculations and validations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function conforms to the standard day counts for months with 30 days, which is crucial for accurate date management and operations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's ability to correctly handle leap year calculations, which is essential for accurate date and time functionalities during leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in a common scenario, non-leap years, which is vital for correct date management and operations throughout most years.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the range 1-12, e.g., 0 or 13, and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should handle the error (either by returning a default value like None or raising an appropriate exception).
Validation:
  Checks the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous input, ensuring the function's reliability and error-resilience in real-world applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test month number as boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles the boundary month values (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for months 1 and 12 with any `leap_year` value.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  Validates the function's correctness at boundary conditions, which helps in confirming the stability and accuracy of the function under edge cases.
