### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January which is month 1).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly identify and return the number of days for months with 31 days, ensuring accuracy in date-related calculations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for all months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April which is month 4).
  Assert: Verify that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy for months with 30 days, which is crucial for correct date handling and calculations in applications.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential for validating the function's capability to correctly calculate the days in February during a leap year, which is fundamental for date operations in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function accurately identifies non-leap years and assigns February the correct number of days, which is critical for all date-related functionalities in such years.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 0 or 13).
  Assert: The function should handle the error or return a default value; since the function lacks error handling, observe the behavior.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function deals with edge cases and invalid input, which is important for maintaining robustness and avoiding crashes or unexpected behavior in applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test with minimum and maximum valid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_month_numbers
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly handles the edge cases for the smallest and largest valid month numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Test the function with month set to 1 and 12, respectively.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns the correct days for January (31 days) and December (31 days).
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the function's reliability across the full range of valid month inputs, confirming that boundary conditions are handled correctly.
