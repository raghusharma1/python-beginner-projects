### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months with 31 days, which is crucial for date-related calculations in various applications.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months having 30 days, which is necessary for accurate month-length calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the leap_year is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's capability to correctly handle leap years, which is essential for date calculations in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the leap_year is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Testing for correct behavior in non-leap years is crucial as it ensures the function's reliability across all years for date and scheduling applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number (lower boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number less than 1 is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by raising an error or returning None.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function handles invalid input gracefully is important for maintaining robustness in applications using this function.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month number (upper boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number greater than 12 is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by raising an error or returning None.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly validates input parameters, crucial for avoiding calculation errors in applications dependent on accurate date management.
