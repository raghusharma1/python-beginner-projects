### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which are expected to have 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, etc., ensuring it correctly identifies and returns 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test if February returns 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly identifies leap years and applies the special rule for February, providing 29 days instead of the typical 28.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Critical for ensuring that the function adheres to the standard rule for February in non-leap years, reinforcing its accuracy in date handling.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower bound
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_bound
  Description: Check the function's response when provided with a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter less than 1 (e.g., 0).
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning None or raising an exception.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by verifying that the function can handle erroneous input values gracefully, preventing potential crashes or undefined behaviors.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper bound
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_bound
  Description: Assess the function's behavior with a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter greater than 12 (e.g., 13).
  Assert: Expect the function to handle this input appropriately, perhaps by returning None or raising an exception.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the functionâ€™s resilience against incorrect inputs, ensuring it remains stable and predictable even when faced with unexpected values.
