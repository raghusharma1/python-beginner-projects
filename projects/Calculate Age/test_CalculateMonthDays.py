### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which are expected to have 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming it returns 30 days as expected.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The result should be 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns February 29 days in such years, aligning with leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The result should be 28.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy in standard years where February should only have 28 days, vital for non-leap year calendar accuracy.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the valid range (e.g., 13).
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning None or raising an error.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness by checking how the function handles unexpected or erroneous input, which is critical for maintaining stability in software that relies on date calculations.

These test scenarios cover various normal and edge cases, ensuring that the month_days function behaves as expected across all typical and atypical inputs. Each test aligns with a specific aspect of the Gregorian calendar, confirming the function's reliability and accuracy in date handling.
