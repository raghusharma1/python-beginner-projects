### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with a month parameter for any of the months having 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Verify that the result is 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming its accuracy and reliability for routine uses.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring the function correctly calculates the days in February during leap years, a critical requirement for accurate date and time management in applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 28.
Validation:
  This scenario verifies the function's ability to handle the common case of February in non-leap years, ensuring functionality aligns with standard calendar expectations.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Check the function's behavior when provided a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with a month value of 0.
  Assert: Expectation for this test would be based on how the function is defined to handle such cases (e.g., throw an error, return None).
Validation:
  Evaluates the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with invalid input, ensuring stability and reliability in consumer applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify how the function behaves when the month value exceeds 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value of 13.
  Assert: The expected behavior needs to be defined (e.g., error handling, returning None).
Validation:
  This test checks the function's resilience and error management when encountering out-of-range values, safeguarding against potential bugs in edge cases.

These scenarios collectively ensure the function `month_days` operates as expected across standard, edge, and error cases, maintaining both functionality and robustness in handling date-related information.
