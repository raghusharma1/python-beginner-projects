### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months with 31 days, which is crucial for date-related operations in any system using this calendar.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months with 30 days, a fundamental requirement for accurate date handling.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 29 days for February when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the function correctly calculates February days in leap years, aligning with leap year rules which are critical for date calculations in various applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure the function returns 28 days for February when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle standard calendar rules for non-leap years, which is vital for maintaining accurate annual date cycles.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the month number is less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by returning None or raising an exception.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness of the function by handling erroneous input gracefully, preventing undefined behavior in the broader system.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Ensure the function handles cases where the month number is greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning None or raising an exception.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to deal with out-of-range values, ensuring stability and reliability in date-related functionalities.

Each scenario ensures that `month_days` behaves correctly across expected and edge cases, guaranteeing reliable date calculations essential for any application relying on accurate calendaring.
