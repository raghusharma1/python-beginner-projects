### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the function handles months with 31 days correctly as per Gregorian calendar standards.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Validate that the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11].
  Assert: Confirm that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the correct number of days in months with 30 days, aligning with standard calendar expectations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to correctly identify leap years and adjust February's day count accordingly, which is crucial for date calculations in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function accurately recognizes non-leap years and provides the correct day count for February, which is essential for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Check the function's behavior when provided with a month number less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=0 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, potentially returning None or raising an exception.
Validation:
  Testing with invalid month inputs ensures robustness and error handling capabilities of the function, preventing unexpected behaviors in the system.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Assess the function's response when the month number is greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=13 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Expect the function to either return None or raise an exception.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's strength in dealing with out-of-range inputs, which helps maintain the integrity and reliability of the application using this function.
