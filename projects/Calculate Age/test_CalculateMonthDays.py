### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January which is month 1).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly identify and return the number of days for months that have 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date-related computations in applications.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April which is month 4).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's capability to handle months with 30 days correctly, which is important for maintaining calendar accuracy in applications that manage date data.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test to confirm that February has 29 days in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Verify that the returned number of days is 29.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the leap year rule, which adds an extra day to February. This is essential for applications that perform date calculations over multiple years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February has 28 days in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's accuracy in handling February in non-leap years, ensuring correct date management in standard years.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensure that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 0 or 13).
  Assert: Check how the function reacts (e.g., returns None, raises an exception).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous input, which can be crucial in preventing errors in larger systems where incorrect month values might be passed inadvertently.

#### Scenario 6: Test month boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify correct day count for boundary month values (December and January).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for December (12) and January (1) and verify both.
  Assert: Ensure that December returns 31 days and January returns 31 days.
Validation:
  Testing boundary months ensures that the function performs consistently across year-end transitions, which is vital for applications tracking or forecasting events across years.
