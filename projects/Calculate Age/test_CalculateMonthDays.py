### Scenario 1: Test for months with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days, regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the `month_days` function for each month that should have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) with both leap year and non-leap year flags.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 31 for each invocation.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Ensuring the function returns 31 days for these months aligns with standard Gregorian calendar rules, making this test critical for calendar-related applications.

### Scenario 2: Test for months with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: This test checks that the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days, irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the `month_days` function for each month that should have 30 days (April, June, September, November) with both leap year and non-leap year flags.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 30 for each invocation.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Accurately returning 30 days for these months is essential for correctness in applications that depend on accurate date calculations.

### Scenario 3: Test for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call the `month_days` function with February (2) as the month and `True` for the leap year flag.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 29.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Leap years add a day to February, making this test crucial for validating the function's ability to correctly handle leap year logic.

### Scenario 4: Test for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Call the `month_days` function with February (2) as the month and `False` for the leap year flag.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns 28.
Validation:
  Rationalize: Verifying the correct day count for February in non-leap years is essential for accuracy in date-related functionalities.

### Scenario 5: Test for invalid month values
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_values
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when provided with an invalid month value (e.g., 0, 13, -1).
Execution:
  Arrange: N/A
  Act: Invoke the `month_days` function with invalid month values and any boolean value for the leap year flag.
  Assert: Assess how the function handles these cases, whether it throws an error, returns `None`, or handles it gracefully in another manner.
Validation:
  Rationalize: While not directly related to correct day counts, ensuring robust error handling for invalid input is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of software systems using this function.
