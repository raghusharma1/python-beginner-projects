### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test for January in a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_common_year
  Description: Verify that January in a common year returns 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, False)`
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it's a leap year or not. This test ensures that the function correctly returns 31 days for January in a non-leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February in a leap year returns 29 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`
  Assert: Check that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test checks if the function correctly identifies a leap year and returns the appropriate number of days for February.

#### Scenario 3: Test for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February in a non-leap year returns 28 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`
  Assert: Check that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test confirms that the function accurately returns 28 days for February during non-leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test for April
Details:
  TestName: test_april_days
  Description: Verify that April returns 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, False)` and `month_days(4, True)`
  Assert: Check that both calls return 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days, irrespective of leap year status. This test ensures the function's consistency in returning 30 days for April in both leap and non-leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Test for December
Details:
  TestName: test_december_days
  Description: Verify that December returns 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(12, False)` and `month_days(12, True)`
  Assert: Check that both calls return 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days, regardless of the year type. This test confirms the function correctly returns 31 days for December.

#### Scenario 6: Test with an invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Attempt to call `month_days(13, True)` or any invalid month number.
  Assert: Expect an error handling mechanism or a specific return value indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  The function should properly handle cases where an invalid month is passed. This test verifies the robustness of the function in dealing with incorrect inputs.

#### Scenario 7: Test for edge case with month number at lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_lower_boundary_month
  Description: Verify that the function handles the lowest valid month number correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, True)` and `month_days(1, False)`
  Assert: Check that both calls return 31.
Validation:
  Testing the boundary condition ensures that the function correctly handles the smallest valid month number.

These scenarios will thoroughly test the `month_days` function across typical use cases and edge cases, ensuring that it behaves as expected under various conditions.
