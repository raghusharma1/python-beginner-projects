### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all have 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function returns 30 days for April, June, September, and November validates its adherence to standard calendar structure and accuracy in days calculation.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, a fundamental requirement for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle standard years correctly by ensuring February has 28 days, aligning with common calendar expectations.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input (e.g., 0) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0.
  Assert: Check how the function behaves (whether it returns None, raises an error, etc.).
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's robustness in dealing with out-of-range values, ensuring error handling or validation mechanisms are in place.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input (e.g., 13) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13.
  Assert: Check how the function behaves (whether it returns None, raises an error, etc.).
Validation:
  Similar to the previous test, this checks how the function handles values that are outside expected ranges, which is essential for maintaining the reliability and stability of the software using this function.
