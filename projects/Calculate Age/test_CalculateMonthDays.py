### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months such as April, June, September, and November, which have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, a fundamental requirement for accurate date handling.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function is capable of accurately calculating the days in February for non-leap years, which is essential for proper date management in many real-world applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, potentially by returning None or raising an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous input, which is vital to ensuring the reliability and stability of software that depends on date handling.

Each of these scenarios ensures that `month_days` functions correctly across different cases and handles both typical and edge cases according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar.
