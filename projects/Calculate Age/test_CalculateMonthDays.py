### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify days in January for a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january_common_year
  Description: This test verifies that January in a common year has 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare month and leap_year values (1, False).
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test confirms the function correctly implements this invariant.

#### Scenario 2: Verify days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: This test checks that February in a leap year has 29 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare month and leap_year values (2, True).
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year, and this test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns the correct number of days to February.

#### Scenario 3: Verify days in February during a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_common_year
  Description: Verify that February in a common year has 28 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare month and leap_year values (2, False).
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  Ensuring that February is correctly handled in non-leap years is crucial, as it is the only month with varying day counts based on the year type.

#### Scenario 4: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: Ensure that April has 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare month and leap_year values (4, either True or False).
  Act: Call month_days(4, True) or month_days(4, False).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  April should always have 30 days, irrespective of whether the year is a leap year. This test confirms consistent behavior for months with fixed day counts.

#### Scenario 5: Verify days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Confirm that December has 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare month and leap_year values (12, either True or False).
  Act: Call month_days(12, True) or month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This scenario checks the functionâ€™s capability to handle months consistently at the end of the year.

#### Scenario 6: Verify function with invalid month value
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_value
  Description: Test how the function behaves with an invalid month input (e.g., 13 or 0).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare invalid month values (e.g., 13 or 0) with a valid leap year status.
  Act: Call month_days with an invalid month and observe the behavior.
  Assert: The function should ideally handle this gracefully, possibly by returning None or throwing an exception.
Validation:
  Robustness in handling erroneous inputs is essential for reliable software. This test ensures that the function can manage such cases appropriately, which is not defined in the initial function but is crucial for comprehensive testing.

These scenarios cover a range of typical and edge cases to ensure that the `month_days` function behaves as expected across all valid and some invalid inputs, aligning with business rules regarding calendar days per month.
