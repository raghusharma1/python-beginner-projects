### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming its accuracy in returning 30 days for these months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  Checks the function's capability to correctly adjust the number of days in February during leap years, a critical requirement for accurate date and time management in applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function accurately calculates the days in February for non-leap years, maintaining consistency with the Gregorian calendar and ensuring reliability in date calculations.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Assess the function's handling of an invalid month number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the range 1-12, e.g., 13.
  Assert: The function's behavior needs to be defined by the developer; it could raise an exception, return None, or handle it in another specific way.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the function by handling or guarding against invalid input, which is essential for preventing runtime errors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test with minimum and maximum valid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_month_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the edge cases for the smallest and largest valid month numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` separately with month set to 1 and 12.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases, such as the boundaries of the month input, thereby ensuring it functions accurately across all valid month inputs.
