### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the argument for a month that has 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all return 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the argument for a month that has 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Ensuring accuracy for months like April, June, September, and November which have 30 days according to the Gregorian calendar is essential for calendar-related functionalities.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the arguments for February (`month=2`) and set `leap_year=True`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to correctly handle leap years, which is crucial for applications relying on precise date calculations.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the arguments for February (`month=2`) and set `leap_year=False`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's correctness in standard years, ensuring reliability for basic calendar functionality.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input (e.g., month=0) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with `month=0` and any valid `leap_year` value.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate exception or error handling mechanism to be triggered.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's robustness against invalid input, safeguarding against potential errors in downstream functionalities.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input (e.g., month=13) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with `month=13` and any valid `leap_year` value.
  Assert: Expect an appropriate exception or error handling mechanism to be triggered.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is protected against user input errors and provides reliable feedback for out-of-range values, maintaining the integrity of the application.
