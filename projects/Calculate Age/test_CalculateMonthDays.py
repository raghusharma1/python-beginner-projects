### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all return 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Ensuring accuracy for months like April, June, September, and November which have 30 days is crucial for applications relying on accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Validate that February returns 29 days when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is important for confirming the function's ability to correctly handle leap years, which are essential for precise calendrical calculations, particularly in scheduling and forecasting applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This is crucial for validating the function's handling of non-leap years, ensuring accuracy in calendrical functions across various applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensure that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the valid range (e.g., 13).
  Assert: Check that an appropriate error or default behavior occurs (this might depend on how the function is expected to handle such cases, which isn't specified in the question).
Validation:
  Testing with invalid month numbers checks the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous input, which is vital for maintaining reliability in real-world applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test minimum edge case for month
Details:
  TestName: test_minimum_edge_month
  Description: Test the function with the minimum edge case (month = 1).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 1.
  Assert: Validate that the result is 31.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases at the lower boundary of the month input.

#### Scenario 7: Test maximum edge case for month
Details:
  TestName: test_maximum_edge_month
  Description: Test the function with the maximum edge case (month = 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 12.
  Assert: Validate that the result is 31.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases at the upper boundary of the month input, ensuring consistent behavior at all valid input levels.
