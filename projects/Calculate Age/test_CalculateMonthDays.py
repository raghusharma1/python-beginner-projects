### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function adheres to this rule.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year, and this test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns the correct number of days to February.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test confirms that the function properly calculates the days for February in non-leap years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, irrespective of whether it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 30.
Validation:
  April has 30 days regardless of leap year status. This test checks that leap year status does not affect months with a fixed number of days.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, irrespective of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days, and this test ensures the function consistently returns the correct number of days.

### Scenario 6: Testing month boundary condition with the lowest valid month
Details:
  TestName: test_lowest_valid_month
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for January, the lowest valid month in a year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the boundary condition of the lowest month number correctly.

### Scenario 7: Testing month boundary condition with the highest valid month
Details:
  TestName: test_highest_valid_month
  Description: Verify that the function handles December, the highest valid month, correctly by returning 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  Testing the highest month boundary ensures the function correctly handles the upper limit of valid month inputs.

### Scenario 8: Testing response to an invalid month number (too low)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_low_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number (e.g., 0) by returning None or an appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(0, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is None or an error is raised.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling month numbers that are outside the valid range, ensuring graceful failure or error notification.

### Scenario 9: Testing response to an invalid month number (too high)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_high_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number (e.g., 13) by returning None or an appropriate error.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is None or an error is raised.
Validation:
  Similar to Scenario 8, this test ensures the function can effectively deal with input values that exceed the valid range of months, maintaining robustness and error handling.
