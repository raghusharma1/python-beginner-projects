### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standard for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, each having 30 days, confirming its accuracy in month day count.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it checks the function's ability to correctly calculate the days in February during a leap year, a key requirement for any calendar-related functionality.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in handling the typical case for February in non-leap years, aligning with standard calendar expectations.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Test how the function behaves with a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0.
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly returning None or raising an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This scenario is important for verifying the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when provided with out-of-range input.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Test the function with a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle this gracefully, possibly returning None or raising an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  Validates the function's error handling and robustness when faced with inputs that exceed expected values, ensuring the function's reliability and stability.

These scenarios collectively ensure that `month_days` operates correctly across valid and edge-case scenarios, adhering to defined behaviors for a calendar function.
