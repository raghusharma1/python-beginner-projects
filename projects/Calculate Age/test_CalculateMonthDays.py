### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with parameters representing January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), or December (12) and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function adheres to standard Gregorian calendar rules for months with 31 days. The result is crucial for applications relying on accurate date calculations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with parameters for April (4), June (6), September (9), or November (11) and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function complies with the standard Gregorian calendar rules for months with 30 days, which is essential for correct date handling in many systems.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with parameters for February (2) and `leap_year` as True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function correctly implements leap year logic, which is vital for applications involving date calculations over multiple years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with parameters for February (2) and `leap_year` as False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in non-leap years for February, affecting any date-dependent functionality in software, especially those relying on accurate day counts.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month values
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_values
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month values gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with invalid month values such as 0, 13, -1, or any non-integer that might be mistakenly passed.
  Assert: The function should ideally handle errors gracefully, possibly by returning `None` or raising a specific exception (not defined in the current implementation).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness and error handling capabilities, ensuring that the function behaves predictably even with incorrect input.

#### Scenario 6: Test with boundary month values
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_values
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the boundary values for months.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the boundary month values 1 and 12.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both calls, as both January and December have 31 days.
Validation:
  Testing boundary values ensures there are no off-by-one errors in the functionâ€™s month handling logic, which is crucial for reliable application performance.
