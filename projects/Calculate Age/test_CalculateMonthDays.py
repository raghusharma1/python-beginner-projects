### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming it returns 30 days as expected.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count to 29, adhering to leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy in handling non-leap years by returning 28 days for February, which is crucial for calendar accuracy and scheduling applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Assert: The function should handle this case, possibly by returning `None` or raising an exception.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by confirming that the function can handle erroneous input without crashing, which is critical for maintaining application stability.

#### Scenario 6: Test edge case month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_month_numbers
  Description: Check the function's behavior with edge month numbers like 1 and 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with months 1 and 12.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles edge cases in the input range, which is essential for complete coverage and preventing off-by-one errors.

Each test scenario is designed to validate the correctness and robustness of the `month_days` function according to the rules of the Gregorian calendar and common expectations for handling erroneous or edge-case inputs.
