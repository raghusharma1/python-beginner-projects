### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months such as April, June, September, and November, which have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, a fundamental requirement for accurate date and time management.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function accurately calculates the days in February for non-leap years, aligning with standard calendar expectations.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower bound
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_bound
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input (less than 1) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is raised or an error message is returned.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness in handling unexpected or erroneous input, which is vital for maintaining the reliability of the application.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper bound
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_bound
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input (greater than 12) gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13.
  Assert: Check that an appropriate exception is raised or an error message is returned.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's ability to deal with inputs that fall outside the valid range of months, ensuring that the function is not prone to errors or incorrect behavior due to invalid inputs.

These scenarios collectively ensure the function behaves correctly across all valid inputs and gracefully handles invalid inputs, aligning with both business requirements and typical usage patterns in calendar-related functionalities.
