```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 for months that traditionally have 31 days, regardless of the year being a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., 1 for January).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which must always have 31 days.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 for months that traditionally have 30 days, independent of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., 4 for April).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 30.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function upholds the standard calendar convention for months like April, June, September, and November, which consistently have 30 days.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to True.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 2 (February).
  Assert: Verify that the outcome is 29.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly adjust February's day count in leap years, aligning with the leap year rule that adds an extra day to maintain calendar and seasonal alignment.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to False.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 2 (February).
  Assert: Verify that the outcome is 28.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function correctly identifies non-leap years and assigns February the standard 28 days, maintaining consistency with common non-leap year calendar rules.

Scenario 5: Test with an invalid month number (less than 1)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_below_range
  Description: Check how the function behaves with a month number less than 1, which is outside the valid range of months.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with a month parameter set to a value less than 1 (e.g., 0).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific return value that indicates invalid input (the function must be modified to handle this case correctly).
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in handling erroneous inputs that fall outside the expected range of month values, ensuring error handling and data validation.

Scenario 6: Test with an invalid month number (greater than 12)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_above_range
  Description: Verify the function's response to a month number greater than 12, which is outside the conventional range.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with a month parameter set to a value greater than 12 (e.g., 13).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific return value that signals invalid input (the function must be modified to handle this case appropriately).
Validation:
  Similar to Scenario 5, this scenario ensures that the function can effectively manage inputs that do not correspond to valid month values, safeguarding against incorrect data processing.
```

Each scenario is designed to validate critical aspects of the `month_days` function, ensuring it operates correctly across all typical and edge cases according to the defined rules of the Gregorian calendar and input validation standards.
