### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standard for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates that the function accurately represents months like April, June, September, and November which consistently have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to correctly compute the days in February during a leap year, adhering to the leap year rule that adds an extra day to February.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in computing the standard 28 days for February in non-leap years, which is crucial for correct date and time management in applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month parameter like 13 or 0, and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle the case (either by returning None, raising an exception, or another defined behavior).
Validation:
  This test checks that the function can safely handle erroneous input, which is vital for maintaining robustness in applications using this function. Note: This test scenario is based on assumptions of function behavior with invalid input as the original function does not explicitly handle this case.

#### Scenario 6: Test leap year boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_year_boundary
  Description: Test the function at the boundary between a leap year and a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 first with leap_year set to True and then set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 29 for the leap year and 28 for the non-leap year.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly identifies and reacts to the leap year status change, which is critical for applications relying on accurate date calculations across years.
