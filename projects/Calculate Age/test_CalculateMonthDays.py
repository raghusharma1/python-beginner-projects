### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming its accuracy in returning 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test that February returns 29 days when the `leap_year` parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The result should be 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns February 29 days in such cases, aligning with leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February returns 28 days when the `leap_year` parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The result should be 28.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy in standard years where February should have 28 days, ensuring it handles non-leap years correctly.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (lower boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Test how the function behaves when passed a month number less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0.
  Assert: The function might throw an error or return None (depending on how the function should handle this case).
Validation:
  This test will help in understanding how the function handles unexpected input, ensuring robustness in the face of erroneous data.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number (upper boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Assess the function's behavior when passed a month number greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13.
  Assert: Similar to Scenario 5, the function might throw an error or return None.
Validation:
  Validates how the function safeguards against incorrect input values, critical for maintaining integrity and preventing misinterpretations in larger applications.

These scenarios thoroughly test the `month_days` function across valid and edge cases, ensuring it behaves as expected according to the Gregorian calendar and handles error conditions gracefully.
