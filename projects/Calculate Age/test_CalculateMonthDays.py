### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar system where specified months have 31 days, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11].
  Assert: The return value should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months that are consistently 30 days long, supporting correct date calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's capability to correctly handle leap years, which is crucial for accurate date-related operations in software dealing with time data.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Test if February returns 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy for non-leap years, aligning with the standard Gregorian calendar rules, essential for any date calculation logic in applications.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=0 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Assess how the function behaves (e.g., does it raise an exception, return None, etc.).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's robustness against incorrect inputs, ensuring it fails gracefully or handles unexpected values correctly, which is vital for reliability.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Check the function's response to a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=13 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Evaluate the function's response for handling out-of-range values.
Validation:
  Examines the function's error handling capabilities when faced with non-existent month values, crucial for maintaining application stability and data integrity.

These scenarios ensure comprehensive coverage of the `month_days` function's expected behavior across different inputs and edge cases, aligning with real-world usage and requirements.
