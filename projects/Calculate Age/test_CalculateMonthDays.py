### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 (January) and any boolean for leap_year as it should not affect the result.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months with 31 days, which is crucial for date-related calculations and validations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 4 (April) and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles months with 30 days, which is essential for accurate date operations in software relying on calendar calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 29 days for February when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is vital to verify that the function correctly calculates February's day count in leap years, which is fundamental for any date calculation logic in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's accuracy for February in non-leap years, crucial for date and scheduling applications not to misrepresent the standard calendar.

#### Scenario 5: Test month out of range (lower bound)
Details:
  TestName: test_month_out_of_range_lower
  Description: Ensure that the function handles or rejects month values below 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should either return a default value or raise an error.
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles invalid month inputs, ensuring robustness and error handling in the function's implementation.

#### Scenario 6: Test month out of range (upper bound)
Details:
  TestName: test_month_out_of_range_upper
  Description: Ensure that the function handles or rejects month values above 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13 and any boolean for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should either return a default value or raise an error.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to deal with out-of-range month values, which is important for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the application using this function.
