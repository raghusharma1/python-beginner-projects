### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns 31 days for January regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (1, True) and (1, False).
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies January as a 31-day month, which is consistent with the Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test checks that April always has 30 days, independent of the leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (4, True) and (4, False).
  Assert: Check if the return value is 30 for both calls.
Validation:
  This test verifies that April is correctly identified as a 30-day month, aligning with its definition in the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Verify days in February on a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that February has 29 days during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameter (2, True).
  Assert: Check if the return value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is critical to ensure that the leap year rule is correctly applied, providing an extra day in February.

#### Scenario 4: Verify days in February on a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February has 28 days during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameter (2, False).
  Assert: Check if the return value is 28.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's accuracy in handling standard years where February should only have 28 days.

#### Scenario 5: Verify days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Test to ensure December is recognized as a 31-day month.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters (12, True) and (12, False).
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function consistently applies to December, correctly identifying it as a 31-day month.

#### Scenario 6: Invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Attempt to call `month_days` with an invalid month number, such as 13 or 0.
  Assert: Check the behavior or result; this might depend on whether the function is modified to handle errors or simply returns None.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the function in dealing with incorrect inputs that fall outside the expected range of month values.

These scenarios cover various typical and edge cases, ensuring that `month_days` behaves as expected across all valid inputs and handles invalid inputs appropriately. Each test is crucial for validating the function's adherence to the defined rules of the Gregorian calendar and ensuring data integrity in applications relying on this function.
