### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy in returning the correct number of days for April, June, September, and November, helping in accurate date and time calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is 29.
Validation:
  Critical for ensuring that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns 29 days to February, which is essential for date-sensitive applications and calculations during leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Ensure that the result is 28.
Validation:
  Validates that the function properly handles standard years by assigning February 28 days, critical for date and scheduling applications in non-leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Test month with invalid number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify how the function behaves when given a month number outside the typical range (1-12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Assert: Check whether the function returns None, an error, or handles it gracefully.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with unexpected or erroneous input values, protecting the application from potential crashes or undefined behaviors.

#### Scenario 6: Test month with edge values
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_month_values
  Description: Validate the function with edge month values like 1 and 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for both January (1) and December (12).
  Assert: Verify that January returns 31 and December returns 31.
Validation:
  Tests the boundaries of the function's input range to ensure it handles the lowest and highest valid month values correctly, which is crucial for boundary testing and ensuring no off-by-one errors.
