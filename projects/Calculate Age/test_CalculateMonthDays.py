### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all have 31 days regardless of whether it's a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly handle months like April, June, September, and November, ensuring compliance with their standard length in the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  Critical for confirming the function's capability to correctly calculate February's day count during leap years, aligning with the leap year rule of the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test is essential for validating the function's accuracy in non-leap years, ensuring it adheres to the common calendar rule that February has 28 days in such years.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (lower boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when provided with a month number less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 0.
  Assert: Check how the function handles this input, possibly expecting an exception or a specific error message.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by testing how the function deals with unexpected, out-of-range input, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and error handling in applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number (upper boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when provided with a month number greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 13.
  Assert: Check how the function handles this input, possibly expecting an exception or a specific error message.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle erroneous input gracefully, ensuring that the application remains stable and provides meaningful feedback when faced with such scenarios.
