### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months like April, June, September, and November, confirming its accuracy in returning 30 days for these months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Assert that the outcome is 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify the function's ability to correctly calculate the days in February during a leap year, aligning with leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Test that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Critical for ensuring the function's accuracy in non-leap years, confirming that February is correctly recognized as having 28 days.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Assert: The function might return None or raise an error, depending on implementation details not specified.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to check the robustness of the function in handling invalid inputs, ensuring that the function behaves predictably and safely when faced with unexpected or erroneous data.

#### Scenario 6: Test minimal and maximal valid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_month_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles the boundary values for month numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Test the function with month numbers 1 and 12.
  Assert: Verify that correct days are returned for both cases (31 for both January and December).
Validation:
  Tests the function's boundary conditions, ensuring it can handle the lowest and highest valid month values correctly, a basic requirement for reliable date-related functions.
