### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function adheres to this rule.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns February the correct number of days.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in non-leap years. This test checks that the function properly calculates the days for February in non-leap years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, regardless of whether the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days irrespective of the leap year status. This test confirms that leap year status does not affect months with a fixed number of days.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, regardless of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test ensures that the function consistently applies this rule regardless of the leap year status.

### Scenario 6: Testing with invalid month number (greater than 12)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number_high
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, False).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific behavior (e.g., return None or raise an exception).
Validation:
  Testing with an invalid month number checks the function's robustness and error handling capabilities, ensuring it does not produce undefined or incorrect results.

### Scenario 7: Testing with invalid month number (less than 1)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number_low
  Description: Verify that the function handles another form of invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(0, True).
  Assert: Expect an error or a specific behavior similar to the previous test.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle all forms of invalid input regarding the month parameter, safeguarding against potential runtime errors.
