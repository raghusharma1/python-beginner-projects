```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) return 31 irrespective of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Select a month from the list of months that have 31 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to confirm that the function correctly identifies months that traditionally have 31 days and returns the appropriate day count. This is fundamental as it verifies the function's ability to handle months with maximum days.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) return 30, regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Choose a month from the list of months that have 30 days.
  Act: Call month_days function with the selected month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns 30.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's accuracy in returning the correct number of days for months that traditionally have 30 days. It's crucial for the correctness of any application depending on accurate month-day mappings.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 (February) and leap_year to True.
  Act: Call month_days with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 29.
Validation:
  Testing February during a leap year is essential as it verifies the function's ability to adapt to leap year variations, critical for date calculations in leap years.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set month to 2 (February) and leap_year to False.
  Act: Call month_days with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 28.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming the function's accuracy in standard, non-leap years, ensuring correct date management across various year types.

Scenario 5: Test with invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully, potentially by raising an exception or returning a default value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an invalid month number (e.g., 0, 13, -1).
  Act: Call month_days with the invalid month and any leap year value.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the error (either by returning None, a specific error message, or raising an exception).
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness by checking the function's ability to handle erroneous input, which is important for maintaining stability and reliability in consumer applications.

Scenario 6: Test with typical leap year check
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year_check
  Description: Verify that the function correctly identifies typical leap years (e.g., 2020, 2024).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set leap_year to True for known leap years.
  Act: Call month_days for February in these years.
  Assert: Confirm the function returns 29 for February.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function respects typical leap year rules is vital for applications requiring accurate date-time data, such as scheduling and calendaring applications.
