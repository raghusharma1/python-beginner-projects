```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 for months that traditionally have 31 days, regardless of the year being a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year set to either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures the function handles months with 31 days correctly as per the Gregorian calendar, which is critical for date-related calculations in any application.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 for months that traditionally have 30 days, independent of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year set to either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly identify months with 30 days, which is essential for accurate date handling and operations in applications.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to verify the function's capability to correctly adjust the days in February for leap years, following the leap year rule in the Gregorian calendar.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Test if the function correctly returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Confirms the function's accuracy for handling February in non-leap years, which is pivotal for date calculations and validations in software applications.

Scenario 5: Test with an invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Ensure that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully, ideally by throwing an error or handling the unexpected input appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with an invalid month number (e.g., 13, 0, -1) and any value for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should raise an exception or handle the error in a predefined manner (This expected behavior should be defined in the function but isn't in the current implementation).
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in dealing with erroneous inputs, safeguarding against potential bugs or crashes in broader system functionalities.
