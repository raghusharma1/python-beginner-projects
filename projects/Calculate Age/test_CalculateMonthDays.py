```
Scenario 1: Test days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for January, which is expected for the first month.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=1 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly identifies January as a month with 31 days, aligning with standard Gregorian calendar rules.

Scenario 2: Test days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly compute the number of days in February during a leap year, which is crucial for date-related calculations in leap years.

Scenario 3: Test days in February during a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 28.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's accuracy in returning the correct number of days for February in a non-leap year, ensuring correct date management in standard years.

Scenario 4: Test days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=4 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 30.
Validation:
  Ensures that April is recognized as a month with 30 days, which is consistent with its definition in the Gregorian calendar.

Scenario 5: Test days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=12 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  Confirms that December is correctly identified as a month with 31 days, adhering to the calendar rules and aiding in accurate date calculations.

Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=13 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check how the function behaves; expect an error or a specific return value indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness in the function's design by checking its response to incorrect inputs, which helps prevent runtime errors in larger applications.

Scenario 7: Test month boundary values
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_values
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the boundary month values (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=1 and month=12 in separate tests, both with leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31 for both cases.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's correctness at the boundary values of the month parameter, confirming adherence to calendar rules at edge cases.
