### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months such as April, June, September, and November, which have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's day count accordingly, a fundamental requirement for accurate date handling in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the function correctly handles the standard scenario for February in non-leap years, adhering to the typical calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter outside the valid range (e.g., 0 or 13).
  Assert: Check how the function reacts (e.g., returns None, raises an exception).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the function in handling erroneous input, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of software that depends on date handling.

#### Scenario 6: Test edge case for month boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_for_month_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles the boundary values for month inputs (e.g., 1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 and 12, respectively.
  Assert: Check that the returned values are correct according to the Gregorian calendar (31 days for both).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function accurately processes the boundary values for months, which is vital for preventing off-by-one errors in date-related calculations.
