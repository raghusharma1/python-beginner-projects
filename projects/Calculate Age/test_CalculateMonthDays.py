### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test for January in a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_common_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January in a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  Rationalize that January always has 31 days, regardless of whether it's a leap year or not. This test confirms the function adheres to calendar norms.

#### Scenario 2: Test for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  Since February has 29 days in a leap year, this test ensures the function correctly implements this leap year rule.

#### Scenario 3: Test for February in a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_common_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February in a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly handles the usual case for February in non-leap years, aligning with standard calendar rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test for April in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_any_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, regardless of the year type.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days(4, False) and month_days(4, True).
  Assert: Both calls should return 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days; this test confirms that the function is consistent with this fact under any year condition.

#### Scenario 5: Test for December in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days(12, True).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  December has 31 days, irrespective of whether it's a leap year. This test ensures the function's accuracy in handling months with fixed day counts.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Attempt to call month_days(13, True) and month_days(0, False).
  Assert: The function should handle the error or return a default/error value.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's robustness in dealing with out-of-range values for months, which is crucial for avoiding errors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 7: Test for July in a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_july_common_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for July in a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days(7, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  Testing July ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days, crucial for accurate date and scheduling applications.

These scenarios ensure comprehensive coverage of the `month_days` function, from standard cases to edge scenarios, ensuring reliability and correctness in various conditions.
