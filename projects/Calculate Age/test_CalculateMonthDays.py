### Scenario 1: Testing with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 for months that typically have 31 days, regardless of whether it's a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, and both leap year and non-leap year scenarios.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 31 for all these cases.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days, which is fundamental for accurate date and time handling in applications.

### Scenario 2: Testing with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with parameters for months 4, 6, 9, and 11.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 30.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function can accurately recognize and return the correct number of days for months that have 30 days, which is crucial for calendar-related functionalities.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with month 2 and `leap_year` as True.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules by returning 29 days for February in leap years, which is necessary for date calculations and validations.

### Scenario 4: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with month 2 and `leap_year` as False.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function properly calculates the number of days in February for non-leap years, playing a critical role in date handling and accuracy.

### Scenario 5: Testing invalid month numbers (lower bound)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_bound
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number (less than 1) is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with month 0 and any leap year status.
  Assert: Expect an undefined or error response (the actual behavior should be defined by system requirements).
Validation:
  This test checks how the function handles erroneous input, ensuring robustness and error handling in the application.

### Scenario 6: Testing invalid month numbers (upper bound)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_bound
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when an invalid month number (greater than 12) is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the function `month_days` with month 13 and any leap year status.
  Assert: Expect an undefined or error response (the actual behavior should be defined by system requirements).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly handles out-of-range values, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of applications using this function.
