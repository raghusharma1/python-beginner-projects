```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months known to have 31 days regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a list of months with 31 days, e.g., January, March, May.
  Act: Loop through the list and call month_days for each month with leap_year set to both True and False.
  Assert: Check that the result is 31 for each call.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of the test ensures that months inherently having 31 days return the correct day count irrespective of the leap year condition, matching typical calendar expectations.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of months with 30 days, such as April, June, September.
  Act: Iterate through the list, invoking month_days for each month with leap_year set to both True and False.
  Assert: Confirm that the outcome is 30 for each call.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function adheres to standard calendar months, maintaining accuracy in months with 30 days, which is crucial for applications relying on precise date calculations.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 29 days when leap_year is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify the function's ability to correctly adjust the day count for February in leap years, a fundamental requirement for calendar-related functionality.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days when leap_year is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's correct behavior under standard conditions for February in non-leap years, ensuring accuracy in non-leap year calendar calculations.

Scenario 5: Test with invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of invalid month inputs like 0, 13, -1, 100.
  Act: Loop through the list, calling month_days for each invalid month entry.
  Assert: The function should handle errors or return a default value (if designed to handle such cases).
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the function against erroneous input, safeguarding against potential crashes or unexpected behavior in production environments.
