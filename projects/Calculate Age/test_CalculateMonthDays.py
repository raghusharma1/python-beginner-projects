### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test for January in a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_common_year
  Description: Verify that January in a common year returns 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, False)`
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it's a leap year or not. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies January and returns the appropriate number of days.

#### Scenario 2: Test for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February in a leap year returns 29 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`
  Assert: Check that the return value is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test validates the function's ability to correctly adjust February's day count in leap years.

#### Scenario 3: Test for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February in a non-leap year returns 28 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`
  Assert: Check that the return value is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test checks the function's accuracy in standard years.

#### Scenario 4: Test for April in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_any_year
  Description: Verify that April always returns 30 days, regardless of the year type.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, True)` and `month_days(4, False)`
  Assert: Check that both calls return 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days, irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not. This test ensures that the function is not incorrectly influenced by the leap year flag for months with fixed days.

#### Scenario 5: Test for December in any year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_any_year
  Description: Verify that December always returns 31 days, regardless of the year type.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(12, True)` and `month_days(12, False)`
  Assert: Check that both calls return 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test ensures consistent behavior for months unaffected by leap year calculations.

#### Scenario 6: Test for invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month number gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Try calling `month_days(13, True)` and `month_days(0, True)`
  Assert: Check that the function returns `None` or raises an appropriate error.
Validation:
  There are only 12 months in a year. This test checks the function's robustness when faced with invalid input, ensuring that it fails gracefully without producing misleading results.

#### Scenario 7: Test edge cases for month boundaries
Details:
  TestName: test_month_boundary_cases
  Description: Verify correct behavior at the boundaries of month values (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, True)` and `month_days(12, False)`
  Assert: Check that the first call returns 31 and the second call also returns 31.
Validation:
  Testing boundary values ensures no off-by-one errors in the month handling logic. This is crucial for maintaining accuracy across the entire range of valid month inputs.
