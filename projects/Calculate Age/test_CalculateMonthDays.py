### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which should all have 31 days.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 30.
Validation:
  Ensuring accuracy for months like April, June, September, and November which are expected to have 30 days aligns with standard calendar expectations and confirms the function's reliability for these months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the function's ability to correctly handle the special case of February in leap years, ensuring compliance with leap year rules.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's effectiveness in handling February during non-leap years, which is vital for calendar accuracy and year-round planning.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 13 or 0).
  Assert: Check how the function behaves; expect an error or a specific return value indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Testing with invalid month inputs ensures robustness and error handling of the function, which is important for avoiding crashes or incorrect behavior in real-world applications.

#### Scenario 6: Test with boundary month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles boundary month values (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameters set to 1 and 12 respectively.
  Assert: Check that the returned values are correct for January (31 days) and December (31 days).
Validation:
  Boundary tests ensure the function's accuracy at the edge of valid input ranges, which is essential for ensuring no off-by-one errors or similar issues.

These scenarios collectively test the function's compliance with calendar standards and robustness in handling various inputs, ensuring that it functions correctly across all typical and edge case scenarios.
