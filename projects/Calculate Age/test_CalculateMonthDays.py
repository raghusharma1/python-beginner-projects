```
Scenario 1: Test days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for January, which is expected for the first month.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=1 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's specification that January has 31 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year or not.

Scenario 2: Test days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: Check if February has 29 days in a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to correctly handle the leap year condition for February, which should have 29 days in a leap year, aligning with leap year rules.

Scenario 3: Test days in February during a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February has 28 days in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 28.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial for confirming that the function properly calculates the days in February for non-leap years, which should be 28 days according to standard calendar rules.

Scenario 4: Test days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 30 days for April.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=4 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 30.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the standard calendar specification that April has 30 days, which is consistent regardless of leap year status.

Scenario 5: Test for month out of range (e.g., 13)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month
  Description: Test how the function behaves when provided with an invalid month value, such as 13.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=13 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns None or raises an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with invalid input. The function should either handle this gracefully by returning None or by raising an exception to indicate the error.

Scenario 6: Validate December in non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Check if December has 31 days in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call month_days with month=12 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  Testing December is essential to ensure the function consistently applies to all months having 31 days, irrespective of the leap year status.
