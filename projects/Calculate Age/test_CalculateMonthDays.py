### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., January).
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months like January, March, May, etc., which have 31 days, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month parameter set to one of the months with 30 days (e.g., April).
  Assert: The result should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy in reflecting the standard calendar structure for months like April, June, September, and November, which consistently have 30 days.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  Critical for ensuring the function's compliance with leap year rules, where February has 29 days instead of the usual 28.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  Validates that the function correctly handles standard years by returning 28 days for February, crucial for accurate date and time management in non-leap years.

#### Scenario 5: Test month out of range (lower bound)
Details:
  TestName: test_month_out_of_range_lower
  Description: Ensure the function handles cases where the month value is less than 1 gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value less than 1 (e.g., 0).
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly by raising an error or returning a default value.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness by testing the function's behavior with invalid input, confirming error handling or default responses to prevent crashes or undefined behavior.

#### Scenario 6: Test month out of range (upper bound)
Details:
  TestName: test_month_out_of_range_upper
  Description: Check how the function behaves with a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value greater than 12 (e.g., 13).
  Assert: Expect the function to handle this case gracefully, perhaps by raising an error or returning a default value.
Validation:
  Tests the function's robustness when faced with invalid input, ensuring it handles errors or defaults properly to maintain stability and predictable behavior.

These scenarios thoroughly test the `month_days` function across valid and edge cases, ensuring compliance with calendar rules and robust error handling.
