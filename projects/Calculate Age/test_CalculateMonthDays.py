### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].
  Assert: Check if the return value is 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's specification for months that contain 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date-related calculations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11].
  Assert: The return value should be 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the Gregorian calendar for months having 30 days, which is necessary for applications relying on date and time calculations.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 29 days when the leap_year parameter is True.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=True.
  Assert: The return value should be 29.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to correctly handle leap years by adjusting February's days to 29, which is essential for correctness in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Check if February returns 28 days when the leap_year parameter is False.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month=2 and leap_year=False.
  Assert: The return value should be 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function accurately calculates the days in February for non-leap years, crucial for date operations in most years.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (lower boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Test how the function behaves when provided with a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value less than 1.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the error or return a specific result indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  Validates the function's robustness in dealing with erroneous month inputs, ensuring reliability in negative scenarios.

#### Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number (upper boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Test the function's response to a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with a month value greater than 12.
  Assert: Expect the function to handle the error or return a specific result indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's error handling capabilities for month values outside the valid range, ensuring the function's reliability and stability.

#### Scenario 7: Test month_days with typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify the function with a known leap year, checking all months.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of tuples (month, expected_days) covering all months in a leap year.
  Act: Iterate through the list, calling `month_days` for each month and checking against expected_days.
  Assert: Each month should return the correct number of days as per a leap year setup.
Validation:
  Ensures comprehensive validation across all months in a leap year, essential for applications that perform date calculations over a full year.
