### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's standard months which have 31 days, reflecting accurate month duration.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function accurately calculates the number of days for months that are supposed to have 30 days, following the standard Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the function's ability to correctly handle the special case of February in leap years, which should have 29 days instead of the usual 28.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February in a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly calculates February's days in non-leap years, adhering to the typical calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid month numbers gracefully, potentially by raising an exception or returning a default value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number (e.g., 0, 13, -1) and any boolean value for leap_year.
  Assert: Depending on the intended design, check if an exception is raised or if a default value is returned.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in dealing with user input errors or unusual requests, ensuring the function's reliability and stability.

#### Scenario 6: Test boundary month numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_month_numbers
  Description: Ensure that the function correctly handles the boundary values of month numbers (1 and 12).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 1 and 12, and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31 for both calls.
Validation:
  Boundary testing is essential to verify that edge cases are handled correctly, ensuring the function's accuracy across all valid month inputs.
