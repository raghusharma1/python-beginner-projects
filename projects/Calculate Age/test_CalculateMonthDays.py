### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether it is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function correctly identifies January and its fixed number of days.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February during a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test checks the function's ability to correctly handle leap year logic for February.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February during a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test ensures that the function accurately calculates the days in February during non-leap years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: Check that the result is 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days. This scenario confirms that the function does not mistakenly apply leap year logic to months other than February.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, regardless of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Check that the result is 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. This test ensures the function consistently applies the correct day count for December across different years.

### Scenario 6: Testing with an invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, False) or negative values.
  Assert: Check for a sensible error handling like raising an exception or returning None.
Validation:
  The function should be robust against incorrect inputs. This test checks that the function does not crash or behave unpredictably when faced with invalid month numbers.

### Scenario 7: Testing the boundary of leap year status change
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_of_leap_year_status_change
  Description: Verify that the function correctly transitions from a leap year to a non-leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False) followed by month_days(2, True).
  Assert: First check that the result is 28, then 29.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly updates and returns the day count when transitioning from a non-leap year to a leap year, specifically testing the boundary condition handling.
