### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar's specification for months with 31 days, ensuring accurate date-related calculations.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and leap_year as either True or False.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  Validates the function's compliance with the standard calendar conventions for months with 30 days, crucial for correct date operations in applications.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test to ensure that February returns 29 days when it's a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: The result should be 29.
Validation:
  Critical for ensuring the function can accurately compute days in February during leap years, aligning with leap year rules in the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that February returns 28 days when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: The result should be 28.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's accuracy in standard, non-leap years, critical for date calculations and software relying on correct date information.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_number
  Description: Checks the function's behavior when provided with an invalid month number (e.g., 0, 13).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with an invalid month number such as 0 or 13 and any boolean value for leap_year.
  Assert: The function should handle the situation gracefully, potentially returning None or raising a specific exception.
Validation:
  Validates robustness and error handling of the function when faced with unexpected input, ensuring the function's reliability in diverse conditions.

#### Scenario 6: Test extremes for leap year parameter
Details:
  TestName: test_extreme_leap_year_values
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with extreme boolean values for the leap_year parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with typical month values (e.g., 1 or 2) but use non-boolean values for leap_year like integers, strings, or None.
  Assert: The function should either convert these to boolean or raise an appropriate exception if type checking is enforced.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function can handle or reject non-boolean types for the leap_year parameter, contributing to its robustness in type-varied scenarios.
