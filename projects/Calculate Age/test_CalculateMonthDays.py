### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with each month that should have 31 days.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is 31 for each input.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar standards for months with 31 days, which is crucial for any date-related computations relying on accurate day counts.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days (April, June, September, November).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` for each month that should have 30 days.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is 30 for each input.
Validation:
  Validates that the function complies with the standard lengths of months according to the Gregorian calendar, necessary for accurate date handling and operations in applications.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Test to check if February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a leap year as input.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the output is 29.
Validation:
  Critical for ensuring the function can accurately handle the special case of February in leap years, which is essential for date calculations in scheduling, forecasting, and historical data analysis.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a non-leap year as input.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: Ensure the output is 28.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly handles the most common scenario for February, providing reliability in applications that perform date calculations across multiple years.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the month number is less than 1 (e.g., 0 or negative).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare test cases with month values like 0, -1.
  Act: Call `month_days` with these values.
  Assert: Check for appropriate handling, possibly an error or a default behavior if defined.
Validation:
  Ensures the function's robustness in handling erroneous input, which could originate from user error or miscomputed values in a larger system.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Ensure the function handles cases where the month number is greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare test cases with month values like 13, 14.
  Act: Call `month_days` with these values.
  Assert: Check for appropriate handling, such as throwing an error or default behavior.
Validation:
  Validates the function's capacity to deal with unexpected input gracefully, maintaining system stability and reliability in face of user errors or unusual data.
