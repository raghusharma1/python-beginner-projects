### Scenario 1: Testing January in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_january_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for January when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days regardless of whether the year is a leap year or not. This test validates that the function adheres to this rule.

### Scenario 2: Testing February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns February the correct number of days.

### Scenario 3: Testing February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test checks the function's accuracy in handling the standard case for February in non-leap years.

### Scenario 4: Testing April in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_april_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 30 days for April, regardless of whether it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True).
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  April has 30 days irrespective of leap year status. This test confirms that leap year status does not affect months with a fixed number of days.

### Scenario 5: Testing December in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_december_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for December, regardless of leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, False).
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  December has 31 days irrespective of the leap year. This test ensures the function correctly handles months with a constant number of days.

### Scenario 6: Testing invalid month number
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month
  Description: Verify that the function handles an invalid month input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(13, False) or negative values.
  Assert: The function should handle the invalid input, possibly by throwing an exception or returning a specific error value.
Validation:
  The function is expected to handle only valid month numbers (1-12). This test ensures that the function can handle or report errors for invalid inputs appropriately.
