```
Scenario 1: Test with a month that has 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 for months that traditionally have 31 days, regardless of the year being a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days with the month parameter set to one of the months with 31 days (e.g., 1 for January).
  Assert: Check that the return value is 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules for months such as January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have 31 days irrespective of leap years.

Scenario 2: Test with a month that has 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 30 for months that typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Invoke month_days with a month known to have 30 days (e.g., 4 for April).
  Assert: The expected result is 30.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function correctly implements the standard calendar rules for April, June, September, and November, ensuring it provides the right number of days for these months.

Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Check that February returns 29 days when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 2 and leap_year set to True.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 29.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial for confirming the function's capability to correctly adjust the number of days in February during leap years, in line with leap year rules.

Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that February returns 28 days when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days with month set to 2 and leap_year set to False.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns 28.
Validation:
  Testing February in non-leap years is essential to validate that the function follows the normal rules of the Gregorian calendar for non-leap years, providing the standard 28 days in February.

Scenario 5: Test with invalid month number (lower boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_low
  Description: Assess the function's handling of month numbers less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days with a month value less than 1 (e.g., 0).
  Assert: The function should handle this gracefully, possibly raising an error or returning None.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the function in handling unexpected input, ensuring it fails gracefully or provides a meaningful error message.

Scenario 6: Test with invalid month number (upper boundary)
Details:
  TestName: test_with_invalid_month_number_high
  Description: Evaluate how the function deals with month numbers greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None.
  Act: Call month_days with a month value greater than 12 (e.g., 13).
  Assert: Expect the function to handle this input gracefully, possibly by raising an error or returning None.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function is safeguarded against incorrect input values, maintaining reliability and stability in face of user errors or unexpected inputs.
