### Test Scenarios for the `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test month with 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return 31.
Validation:
  The test ensures the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar for months known to have 31 days. Correct functionality in these cases is crucial as they represent the standard lengths of these months irrespective of leap years.

#### Scenario 2: Test month with 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 30 days for months that usually have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Invoke `month_days` with the month parameter set to one of [4, 6, 9, 11] and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should return 30.
Validation:
  This scenario validates that the function provides correct day counts for months with 30 days, which is essential for applications relying on accurate month-length information for scheduling or planning.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February if the provided year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to True.
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to correctly adjust February's day count in leap years, which is critical for date calculations and validations in leap years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns 28 days for February if the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 2 and `leap_year` set to False.
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function accurately computes the day count for February in non-leap years, a fundamental requirement for all calendar-related functionalities.

#### Scenario 5: Test invalid month lower boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_lower_boundary
  Description: Check how the function behaves when provided with a month value less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 0 (or any negative number) and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: The function should ideally raise an error or handle the input gracefully.
Validation:
  Testing with invalid month inputs ensures the function's robustness and error-handling capabilities, which prevent runtime errors in larger systems.

#### Scenario 6: Test invalid month upper boundary
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_upper_boundary
  Description: Verify the function's response to a month value greater than 12.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter set to 13 (or any number greater than 12) and any value for `leap_year`.
  Assert: Expect the function to raise an error or manage the input appropriately.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's error handling when faced with unrealistic month values, ensuring the function's reliability and stability in diverse conditions.
