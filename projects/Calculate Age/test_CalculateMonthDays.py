### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Verify function returns correct days for January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 31 days for January, regardless of whether it is a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(1, True)` and `month_days(1, False)`.
  Assert: Check that both calls return 31.
Validation:
  The function should consistently return 31 days for January as it is hardcoded for months with 31 days. This confirms the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar.

#### Scenario 2: Verify function returns correct days for April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns 30 days for April in any year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(4, True)` and `month_days(4, False)`.
  Assert: Check that both calls return 30.
Validation:
  April is always 30 days long, and this test ensures that the function upholds this invariant, reflecting the correct implementation of the calendar rules.

#### Scenario 3: Verify function returns correct days for February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, True)`.
  Assert: Assert the result is 29.
Validation:
  During leap years, February has 29 days. This test validates that the function correctly identifies leap years and adjusts February's days accordingly.

#### Scenario 4: Verify function returns correct days for February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, False)`.
  Assert: Assert the result is 28.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function properly handles the standard case for February in non-leap years by returning 28 days, ensuring compliance with common calendar rules.

#### Scenario 5: Verify function handles month values outside typical range
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_values
  Description: This test examines how the function behaves when provided with month values that are outside the 1-12 range.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call `month_days(0, True)` and `month_days(13, False)`.
  Assert: Check how the function handles these cases, possibly expecting an error or a specific return value.
Validation:
  This scenario is important for understanding the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with unexpected input values. It checks if the function can safely handle or reject invalid month inputs.

#### Scenario 6: Verify correct days for all months in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_all_months_in_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that each month returns the correct number of days in a common year.
Execution:
  Arrange: List of tuples with month and expected days for a common year.
  Act: Iterate through the list, calling `month_days` for each month.
  Assert: Validate that each month returns the correct number of days.
Validation:
  This comprehensive test checks the functionâ€™s accuracy across all months in a typical year, ensuring that it behaves consistently and correctly according to established norms of the Gregorian calendar.
