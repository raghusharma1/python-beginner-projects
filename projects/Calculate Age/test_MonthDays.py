### Scenario 1: Verify days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test will verify that calling month_days with January (month 1) returns 31 days regardless of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the method month_days with parameters (1, True) and (1, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days. This test confirms that the function adheres to this rule, thus accurately representing the Gregorian calendar.

### Scenario 2: Verify days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: This test will verify that calling month_days with February (month 2) during a leap year correctly returns 29 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the method month_days with parameters (2, True).
  Assert: The call should return 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year. This test ensures that the function correctly identifies leap years and assigns the correct number of days to February, which is crucial for date calculations involving leap years.

### Scenario 3: Verify days in February during a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: This test will verify that calling month_days with February (month 2) during a non-leap year correctly returns 28 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the method month_days with parameters (2, False).
  Assert: The call should return 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year. This test checks the function's ability to handle non-leap years correctly, which is essential for accurate date and age calculations.

### Scenario 4: Verify days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test will verify that calling month_days with April (month 4) returns 30 days, independent of the leap year status.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the method month_days with parameters (4, True) and (4, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 30.
Validation:
  April always has 30 days. This test ensures that the function is consistent with the standard Gregorian calendar, maintaining accuracy in month-day calculations.

### Scenario 5: Validate response for a month outside the standard range
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_invalid_month
  Description: This test will verify that calling month_days with an invalid month number (e.g., 13) handles the situation appropriately, possibly by returning None or raising an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call the method month_days with parameters (13, True).
  Assert: The call should either return None or raise an error.
Validation:
  Handling invalid months is crucial for robustness. This test ensures that the function can gracefully handle erroneous inputs, which could prevent potential bugs in larger systems depending on this function.
