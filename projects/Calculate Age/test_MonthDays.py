```
Scenario 1: Validating days in January
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_january
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns 31 days for January, irrespective of whether it's a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, True) and month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 31.
Validation:
  January always has 31 days, so the function should return this number regardless of the leap year status, aligning with calendar rules.

Scenario 2: Validating days in February during a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_leap_year
  Description: This test checks if the function returns 29 days for February when it is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, True).
  Assert: The function should return 29.
Validation:
  February has 29 days in a leap year, according to the Gregorian calendar. The function must reflect this to handle dates correctly in leap years.

Scenario 3: Validating days in February during a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_february_non_leap_year
  Description: This test ensures that the function returns 28 days for February when it is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(2, False).
  Assert: The function should return 28.
Validation:
  February has 28 days in a non-leap year, and the function needs to accurately return this count to ensure correct date calculations.

Scenario 4: Validating days in April
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_april
  Description: This test confirms that the function returns 30 days for April.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(4, True) and month_days(4, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 30.
Validation:
  April consistently has 30 days, independent of leap year status. The function's correct operation is crucial for accurate date-related computations.

Scenario 5: Validating days in December
Details:
  TestName: test_days_in_december
  Description: This test confirms that the function correctly returns 31 days for December.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, True) and month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 31.
Validation:
  December always has 31 days. Ensuring this accuracy is essential for correct age and time-related calculations.

Scenario 6: Handling invalid month input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_input
  Description: This test checks how the function behaves when an invalid month (e.g., 0 or 13) is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(0, True) and month_days(13, False).
  Assert: The function should handle these cases gracefully, potentially by raising a ValueError.
Validation:
  The function should only accept valid month numbers (1-12). Proper error handling for invalid inputs is crucial for maintaining function integrity and avoiding unexpected behaviors.

Scenario 7: Edge case for the smallest valid month
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_smallest_valid_month
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles the edge case of the smallest valid month (January).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(1, True) and month_days(1, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 31.
Validation:
  Testing boundary conditions ensures the function's robustness and correctness in handling the full range of valid inputs.

Scenario 8: Edge case for the largest valid month
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_largest_valid_month
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles the edge case of the largest valid month (December).
Execution:
  Arrange: None required.
  Act: Call month_days(12, True) and month_days(12, False).
  Assert: Both calls should return 31.
Validation:
  Similar to the smallest month test, validating the largest month ensures the function accurately processes all valid inputs without error.
