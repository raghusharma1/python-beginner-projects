### Scenario 1: Test interpretation of BMI for underweight category
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_underweight
  Description: Verify that the function correctly interprets a BMI less than 18.5 as underweight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a BMI value that is less than 18.5.
  Act: Call the interpret_bmi function with this BMI value.
  Assert: Check that the returned string correctly identifies the BMI as underweight and includes the exact BMI value.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure that individuals with a BMI in the underweight range receive the correct health classification, which is crucial for appropriate health advice and interventions.

### Scenario 2: Test interpretation of BMI for normal weight category
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_normal_weight
  Description: Ensure that the function accurately classifies a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 as normal weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a BMI value within the normal range.
  Act: Invoke interpret_bmi with this value.
  Assert: Confirm that the response correctly labels the BMI as normal weight and shows the BMI value.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to correctly identify normal weight, helping to reassure individuals about their health status.

### Scenario 3: Test interpretation of BMI for overweight category
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_overweight
  Description: Test if the function correctly classifies a BMI between 24.9 and 29.9 as overweight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set a BMI value in the overweight range.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI.
  Assert: Ensure the output correctly states that the BMI is in the overweight category and includes the BMI value.
Validation:
  Validates the function's accuracy in identifying individuals who may need to consider lifestyle changes to avoid potential health issues.

### Scenario 4: Test interpretation of BMI for obesity class I
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_obese_class_i
  Description: Verify that the function interprets a BMI between 29.9 and 34.9 as obese (Class I).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value within this specific range.
  Act: Execute interpret_bmi with the given BMI.
  Assert: Check that the function's return string correctly classifies the BMI as obese (Class I) and includes the BMI value.
Validation:
  Crucial for ensuring accurate health advisories for individuals in this obesity class, influencing medical and lifestyle recommendations.

### Scenario 5: Test interpretation of BMI for obesity class II
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_obese_class_ii
  Description: Assess if the function correctly interprets a BMI between 34.9 and 39.9 as obese (Class II).
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a BMI value in the range of Class II obesity.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this value.
  Assert: Validate that the response appropriately identifies the BMI as obese (Class II) and displays the BMI value.
Validation:
  Ensures that the classification aligns with medical standards for obesity, guiding appropriate health interventions.

### Scenario 6: Test interpretation of BMI for obesity class III
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_obese_class_iii
  Description: Confirm that the function classifies a BMI of 40 or higher as obese (Class III).
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a BMI value of 40 or more.
  Act: Invoke interpret_bmi with the BMI.
  Assert: Verify that the output accurately states the BMI as obese (Class III) and includes the BMI value.
Validation:
  This test is critical for identifying individuals at the highest risk due to obesity, highlighting the need for immediate and significant health management.

### Scenario 7: Test handling of None as input
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_none_input
  Description: Check how the function handles a None input, which is not a valid BMI value.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement since the input is None.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with None.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns an error message about invalid input.
Validation:
  Validates the function's robustness and error handling, ensuring that it provides informative feedback for inputs that cannot be processed.
