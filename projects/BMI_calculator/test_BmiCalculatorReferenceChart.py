### Test Scenarios for `reference_chart` Function:

**Scenario 1: Valid CSV File Present**
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_csv_file
  Description: Test the function with a valid 'bmi.csv' file to ensure that it reads the data correctly and prints the formatted table.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure 'bmi.csv' contains expected data and is accessible in the correct path.
  Act: Call the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Capture the printed output and verify that it includes the expected table format and data.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to read from a CSV file and correctly utilize the tabulate library for formatting. This test confirms that the function handles normal operation conditions correctly.

**Scenario 2: CSV File Empty**
Details:
  TestName: test_empty_csv_file
  Description: Test how the function behaves when 'bmi.csv' is present but empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty 'bmi.csv' file in the expected directory.
  Act: Call the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Capture the output and verify that the headers are missing or the table is formatted to indicate no data.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling edge cases where the data source is available but contains no data, ensuring graceful handling and appropriate feedback.

**Scenario 3: CSV File Missing**
Details:
  TestName: test_missing_csv_file
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when the 'bmi.csv' file is missing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure 'bmi.csv' does not exist in the directory.
  Act: Call the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Check for exceptions or error messages indicating the file is missing.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's error handling capabilities when an expected input file is unavailable, which is critical for robustness and user feedback.

**Scenario 4: CSV File with Incorrect Format**
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_format_csv_file
  Description: Test the function's handling of a CSV file with incorrect formatting (e.g., missing headers or incorrect delimiter).
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a 'bmi.csv' file with incorrect formatting.
  Act: Call the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Capture the output and check for any error messages or misformatted output indicating a problem.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function can handle or report format issues in the data file, which is important for preventing misleading outputs or errors during usage.

### Testing Guidelines for `reference_chart` Function:
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure that the testing environment mimics the production or expected use environment, including file paths and access permissions.
2. **Mocking Dependencies**: Use mocking frameworks to simulate file operations where necessary. This allows for controlled testing scenarios without relying on actual file I/O operations.
3. **Output Capture**: Since the function prints output, capture stdout during the test to verify the function's output against expected results.
4. **Exception Handling**: Tests should verify that the function handles exceptions gracefully, either by catching them and printing user-friendly messages or letting them propagate appropriately.
5. **Data Integrity**: Verify that the function correctly reads and processes data from the CSV file. This involves checking the integrity and correctness of the output format.
6. **Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases such as empty files, missing files, or files with unexpected content to ensure the function is robust under various circumstances.
7. **Documentation and Comments**: Ensure that each test case is well-documented, explaining what is being tested and why, which aids in maintenance and understanding the purpose of each test.
8. **Repeatability**: Tests should be repeatable and yield consistent results, regardless of the number of times they are executed. This ensures reliability in automated testing environments.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios will help ensure that the `reference_chart` function is thoroughly tested, robust, and reliable in its operation, providing confidence in its deployment and use.
