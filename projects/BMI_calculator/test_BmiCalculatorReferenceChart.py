Scenario 1: Test with valid 'bmi.csv' file
Details:
  TestName: test_reference_chart_valid_file
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function can successfully read data from a valid 'bmi.csv' file and present it in a tabulated format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure a valid 'bmi.csv' file exists in the same directory as the script.
  Act: Invoke the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Check if the output is a tabulated representation of the 'bmi.csv' file.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to read a CSV file and tabulate its contents. If the function fails, it means it cannot perform its basic operation, which is a serious issue.

Scenario 2: Test with an empty 'bmi.csv' file
Details:
  TestName: test_reference_chart_empty_file
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when the 'bmi.csv' file is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty 'bmi.csv' file in the same directory as the script.
  Act: Invoke the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the situation gracefully without crashing or throwing an error.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's robustness and error-handling capability when dealing with edge cases. The function should be able to handle such situations and not crash.

Scenario 3: Test without 'bmi.csv' file
Details:
  TestName: test_reference_chart_without_file
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when the 'bmi.csv' file does not exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure 'bmi.csv' file does not exist in the same directory as the script.
  Act: Invoke the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the situation gracefully, possibly by throwing a meaningful error.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's error-handling capability when the required file does not exist. A good function should be able to handle such situations and not crash.

Scenario 4: Test with 'bmi.csv' file having invalid data
Details:
  TestName: test_reference_chart_invalid_data
  Description: This test is intended to verify how the function behaves when the 'bmi.csv' file contains invalid or malformed data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 'bmi.csv' file with invalid or malformed data in the same directory as the script.
  Act: Invoke the reference_chart function.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the situation gracefully, possibly by throwing a meaningful error or ignoring the invalid lines.
Validation:
  The test validates the function's ability to handle unexpected data scenarios. A robust function should be able to handle such situations and not crash.
