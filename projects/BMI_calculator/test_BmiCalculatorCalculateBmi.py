BEGIN_GUIDELINE

Scenario 1: Validate the correct calculation of BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_calculation
  Description: This test verifies that the calculate_bmi function correctly calculates the BMI given a height and weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and weight variables with known values.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the height and weight variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned BMI matches the expected result.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure the basic functionality of the calculate_bmi function. The expected result is calculated manually to ensure accuracy.

Scenario 2: Validate the handling of zero height
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_height_handling
  Description: This test verifies that the calculate_bmi function correctly handles the case where the height is zero, which should result in a ZeroDivisionError.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height as zero and weight as any non-zero value.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the height and weight variables.
  Assert: Check that the function returns None.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the calculate_bmi function can handle edge cases and does not crash when encountering a ZeroDivisionError. The expected result is None, as it is not possible to calculate a BMI with a height of zero.

Scenario 3: Validate the handling of negative inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_input_handling
  Description: This test verifies that the calculate_bmi function correctly calculates the BMI when given negative inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and weight variables with negative values.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the height and weight variables.
  Assert: Check that the returned BMI is also negative.
Validation:
  Although negative height and weight values might not make sense in a real-world context, this test is important to ensure that the calculate_bmi function handles all possible inputs correctly. The expected result is a negative BMI, as the function does not check for negative inputs.

Scenario 4: Validate the handling of non-numeric inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_non_numeric_input_handling
  Description: This test verifies that the calculate_bmi function throws a TypeError when given non-numeric inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize height and weight variables with non-numeric values.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with the height and weight variables.
  Assert: Check that a TypeError is thrown.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the calculate_bmi function only accepts numeric inputs, as per its specification. The expected result is a TypeError, as the function cannot calculate a BMI with non-numeric inputs.
