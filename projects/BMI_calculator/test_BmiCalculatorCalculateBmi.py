Scenario 1: Normal BMI Calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_bmi_normal
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates BMI when given valid height and weight values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with a known height and weight.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the expected BMI value.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to confirm that the function correctly implements the BMI calculation formula. This is a fundamental requirement of the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Calculation with Zero Height
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_bmi_zero_height
  Description: This test validates that the function correctly handles cases where the height is zero, which would cause a division by zero error in the BMI calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with a weight and a zero height.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns None.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function correctly handles an edge case that could otherwise cause a runtime error. This is important for the robustness and reliability of the function.

Scenario 3: Calculation with Negative Values
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_bmi_negative_values
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles cases where the height or weight is negative, which is not physically meaningful.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with a negative height or weight.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns a negative BMI value.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function does not prevent or correct for negative input values. This is important for understanding the function's behavior and limitations, and may indicate a potential area for improvement in the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Calculation with Extremely Large Values
Details:
  TestName: test_calculate_bmi_large_values
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when given extremely large height and weight values.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the function is stateless.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi function with very large height and weight values.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns a valid BMI value and does not cause any overflow or other errors.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can handle a wide range of input values without causing errors. This is important for the function's robustness and versatility.
