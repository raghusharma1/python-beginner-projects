### Scenario 1: Normal Weight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_weight_classification
  Description: Verify that the function correctly interprets a BMI within the normal weight range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up height and weight values that correspond to a BMI falling within the normal weight range (18.5 to 24.9).
  Act: Call `calculate_bmi` with the given height and weight, pass the result to `interpret_bmi`.
  Assert: Confirm that the output string indicates a normal weight status and includes the calculated BMI.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test by ensuring the function provides accurate health advice based on BMI calculations. The expected result aligns with the function's purpose to guide individuals about their weight status.

### Scenario 2: Underweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_underweight_classification
  Description: Ensure the function identifies and correctly classifies an underweight BMI (<18.5).
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide height and weight values that generate an underweight BMI.
  Act: Calculate BMI and interpret it.
  Assert: Check that the result string indicates an underweight condition with the correct BMI.
Validation:
  Validates that the function can alert users who might be at health risk due to low body weight, fulfilling a critical health advisory role.

### Scenario 3: Overweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_overweight_classification
  Description: Test if the function correctly classifies an overweight BMI (25 to 29.9).
Execution:
  Arrange: Input values for height and weight that result in an overweight BMI.
  Act: Calculate and interpret BMI.
  Assert: The output should reflect an overweight status with an accurate BMI value.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function provides correct health advice for individuals in the overweight BMI range, which is essential for preventive health measures.

### Scenario 4: Obese Class I Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_obese_class_i_classification
  Description: Confirm that the function categorizes BMI correctly as obese Class I (30 to 34.9).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set parameters to yield an obese Class I BMI.
  Act: Run BMI calculation and interpretation.
  Assert: Validate that the output correctly identifies the obesity class with the precise BMI.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to accurately identify higher health risks, aiding in proper health management and interventions.

### Scenario 5: Invalid Input Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_handling
  Description: Check the function's response to non-numeric inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate non-numeric input for height and weight.
  Act: Attempt to execute `main` and capture the output.
  Assert: Verify that the function outputs an error message for invalid inputs.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness and user-friendly error handling in the face of incorrect input types, maintaining the function's usability and reliability.

### Scenario 6: Zero Height Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_height_handling
  Description: Test how the function handles a height of zero, which should not be possible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input zero for height and any valid number for weight.
  Act: Calculate BMI and interpret it.
  Assert: Confirm that the output indicates an invalid input due to zero height.
Validation:
  This test checks for proper error management in scenarios where input values would lead to mathematical errors (division by zero), crucial for maintaining application stability.

### Scenario 7: Reference Chart Accessibility
Details:
  TestName: test_reference_chart_accessibility
  Description: Ensure that the reference chart is correctly displayed without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare to capture the output of the `reference_chart` function.
  Act: Invoke `reference_chart`.
  Assert: Check that the function outputs the BMI chart correctly formatted and without file access errors.
Validation:
  Verifies the utility function's ability to provide additional user information, enhancing the application's value and user experience.
