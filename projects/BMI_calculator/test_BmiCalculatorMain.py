### Scenario 1: Normal Weight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_weight_classification
  Description: Test to ensure that the BMI is correctly calculated and interpreted as 'normal weight' for standard input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height and weight to simulate a user input that is typical for a normal BMI range.
  Act: Execute the main function with the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the output classification is "Your BMI is [calculated_bmi], you have a normal weight."
Validation:
  This test validates that the BMI calculation and interpretation functions are integrated correctly and produce expected results for typical inputs, ensuring the system correctly classifies a 'normal weight' BMI according to health standards.

### Scenario 2: Underweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_underweight_classification
  Description: Verify the function's ability to classify an underweight BMI correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to simulate a low BMI scenario.
  Act: Run the main function with these inputs.
  Assert: The output should indicate that the user is underweight.
Validation:
  Essential to confirm that the application can accurately identify and warn users who are potentially underweight, which is crucial for health monitoring applications.

### Scenario 3: Obese Class III Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_obese_class_iii_classification
  Description: Check that extremely high BMI values are classified as Obese Class III.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide mocked input values that result in a very high BMI.
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: Output should classify the BMI as Obese Class III.
Validation:
  Validates the application's capability to handle and correctly interpret high BMI values, which is important for identifying high-risk individuals.

### Scenario 4: Invalid Height Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_height_input
  Description: Test the response of the system when a non-numeric value is entered for height.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height with a string and a valid number for weight.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: The output should indicate an invalid input error for height.
Validation:
  Ensures that the system robustly handles incorrect data types and guides users towards providing correct input formats.

### Scenario 5: Division By Zero Error
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero_error
  Description: Verify that entering a height of zero, which could cause a division by zero error, is handled gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height as zero and any valid weight.
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: The output should be "Invalid input. Height should be greater than 0."
Validation:
  This scenario is critical to ensure the application does not crash with potentially common input errors and correctly informs the user about the issue.

### Scenario 6: Reference Chart Display
Details:
  TestName: test_reference_chart_display
  Description: Ensure that the reference chart is displayed correctly at the beginning of the function execution.
Execution:
  Arrange: Observe the output for the invocation of the reference_chart function.
  Act: Execute the main function.
  Assert: The reference chart should be printed as expected from the CSV file data.
Validation:
  Validates the integration and correct function of external data (CSV file) and its display, enhancing user understanding and interaction with the BMI scale.

### Scenario 7: Invalid Weight Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_weight_input
  Description: Test how the system handles a non-numeric input for weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide valid numeric input for height and non-numeric input for weight.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: The output should indicate an invalid input error for weight.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the application provides clear feedback on input errors specifically related to weight, promoting correct user input and safeguarding the application's functionality.
