### Scenario 1: Normal Weight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_weight_classification
  Description: Verify that the function correctly interprets a BMI within the normal weight range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up height and weight values that correspond to a BMI falling within the normal weight range (18.5 to 24.9).
  Act: Call the `calculate_bmi` function with the arranged values, then pass the result to `interpret_bmi`.
  Assert: Check if the interpretation message correctly identifies the BMI as normal weight.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by confirming that the function adheres to medical BMI classifications, ensuring users receive accurate health advice.

### Scenario 2: Underweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_underweight_classification
  Description: Ensure the function accurately classifies underweight BMI values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide height and weight values that lead to an underweight BMI (< 18.5).
  Act: Calculate BMI using these values and interpret the result.
  Assert: The outcome should correctly classify the BMI as underweight.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to provide critical health information to users who might be at risk due to low body weight.

### Scenario 3: Overweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_overweight_classification
  Description: Test the function's ability to classify overweight BMIs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input values for height and weight that result in an overweight BMI (25 to 29.9).
  Act: Compute BMI and interpret the result.
  Assert: Confirm the interpretation correctly labels the BMI as overweight.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can alert users about potential health risks associated with being overweight, promoting preventive healthcare.

### Scenario 4: Class I Obesity Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_class_i_obesity_classification
  Description: Verify the classification of Class I obesity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set height and weight values that result in a BMI of 30 to 34.9.
  Act: Calculate and interpret the BMI.
  Assert: Check the output matches Class I obesity classification.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to inform users accurately about higher levels of health risk, which is essential for targeted medical advice.

### Scenario 5: Edge Case for Minimum Normal Weight
Details:
  TestName: test_edge_case_minimum_normal_weight
  Description: Test the boundary value between underweight and normal weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use height and weight values that barely achieve a normal weight BMI (18.5).
  Act: Calculate and interpret the BMI.
  Assert: Verify that the interpretation is for normal weight, not underweight.
Validation:
  Boundary testing ensures the accuracy of classifications at critical thresholds, which is vital for reliable health assessments.

### Scenario 6: Invalid Input Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_input_handling
  Description: Ensure the function handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of non-numeric strings for height and weight.
  Act: Attempt to calculate and interpret BMI.
  Assert: Catch the ValueError and verify that the appropriate error message is displayed.
Validation:
  This test verifies the robustness of the application by checking its ability to handle user errors without crashing, thereby improving user experience.

### Scenario 7: Zero Height Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_height_handling
  Description: Confirm that a height of zero results in an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a zero value for height and a valid weight.
  Act: Attempt to calculate BMI.
  Assert: Check that the result is None and that the interpretation indicates an invalid input due to zero height.
Validation:
  Testing zero input for height is crucial as it checks the application's ability to prevent mathematical errors (division by zero) and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

These scenarios comprehensively cover the expected behaviors, edge cases, and error conditions, ensuring the main function operates reliably and informatively in various situations.
