### Test Scenarios for `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_inputs
  Description: Test the `main` function with valid height and weight inputs to check if the BMI is calculated and interpreted correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for height and weight as valid floating point numbers.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the output matches the expected BMI interpretation for the provided valid inputs.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes valid numerical inputs and provides the appropriate BMI classification, which is essential for accurate health advice to users.

#### Scenario 2: Zero Height Input
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_height_input
  Description: Test the `main` function with a height of zero to verify handling of division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs for height as zero and any valid weight.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the output indicates an invalid input due to zero height.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling cases where the height is zero, which should logically result in an error message, thereby preventing division by zero errors.

#### Scenario 3: Negative Values Input
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_values_input
  Description: Test the `main` function with negative values for height and weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs where either height or weight or both are negative numbers.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output is an error message indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle and report errors when provided with biologically impossible negative values for height and weight.

#### Scenario 4: Non-numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_non_numeric_input
  Description: Test the `main` function with non-numeric inputs for height and weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to be non-numeric strings.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the output is an error message about invalid numerical values.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function properly handles and reports errors when non-numeric values are entered, adhering to the requirement that inputs must be numerical.

#### Scenario 5: Extremely Large Values Input
Details:
  TestName: test_extremely_large_values_input
  Description: Test the `main` function with unreasonably large numbers for height and weight to check for potential overflow issues or unrealistic BMI calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user inputs with extremely large values for height and weight.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the output remains sensible and does not cause computational issues.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large but valid numerical inputs without crashing, which is crucial for the robustness of the application.

### Testing Guidelines
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Mocking User Inputs**: Use mocking tools like `unittest.mock` to simulate user inputs for `input()` calls within the `main` function.
2. **Exception Handling**: Ensure that all possible exceptions (like `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`) are caught and handled gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to the user.
3. **Output Verification**: Check that the output printed to the console matches expected results. This can involve capturing `stdout` and comparing the output strings.
4. **Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases such as boundary values of BMI categories, zero and negative inputs, and very large numbers to ensure the function behaves as expected under all circumstances.
5. **Dependency Checks**: Verify that external dependencies, such as file reads in `reference_chart`, do not affect the test environment by using mocking or stubbing techniques to simulate these dependencies.
6. **Performance Testing**: Although not strictly part of functional testing, ensuring that the function handles large inputs efficiently can be part of a comprehensive test suite.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios aim to ensure thorough testing of the `main` function, covering all logical paths and potential user input errors, thereby enhancing the reliability and robustness of the application.
