```
Scenario 1: Test for normal weight range
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_weight
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly calculates and interprets the BMI for a person of normal weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: We assume a person with a height of 1.75 meters and a weight of 70 kilograms. 
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi and interpret_bmi functions with the given height and weight.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a string stating "Your BMI is 22.86, you have a normal weight.".
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies individuals within the normal weight range according to the BMI classification.

Scenario 2: Test for underweight range
Details:
  TestName: test_underweight
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly calculates and interprets the BMI for a person who is underweight.
Execution:
  Arrange: We assume a person with a height of 1.8 meters and a weight of 50 kilograms.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi and interpret_bmi functions with the given height and weight.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a string stating "Your BMI is 15.43, you are underweight.".
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies individuals who are underweight according to the BMI classification.

Scenario 3: Test for overweight range
Details:
  TestName: test_overweight
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly calculates and interprets the BMI for a person who is overweight.
Execution:
  Arrange: We assume a person with a height of 1.7 meters and a weight of 80 kilograms.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi and interpret_bmi functions with the given height and weight.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a string stating "Your BMI is 27.68, you are overweight.".
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies individuals who are overweight according to the BMI classification.

Scenario 4: Test for obese range
Details:
  TestName: test_obese
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly calculates and interprets the BMI for a person who is obese.
Execution:
  Arrange: We assume a person with a height of 1.6 meters and a weight of 90 kilograms.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi and interpret_bmi functions with the given height and weight.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a string stating "Your BMI is 35.16, you are obese (Class I).".
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly identifies individuals who are obese according to the BMI classification.

Scenario 5: Test for height equal to zero
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_height
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles the ZeroDivisionError correctly when the height is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: We assume a person with a height of 0 meters and any weight.
  Act: Invoke the calculate_bmi and interpret_bmi functions with the given height and weight.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a string stating "Invalid input. Height should be greater than 0.".
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function handles exceptions properly and returns meaningful error messages when the input data is invalid.
