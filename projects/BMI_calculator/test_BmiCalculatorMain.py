### Test Scenarios for `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Inputs with Normal Weight BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_normal_weight
  Description: Test the main function with valid height and weight inputs that result in a BMI indicating normal weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for height and weight to valid values that calculate to a normal BMI.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output string indicates a normal BMI.
Validation:
  Validates that the `main` function correctly calculates and interprets BMI for normal weight based on standard BMI categories.

#### Scenario 2: Valid Inputs with Underweight BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_underweight
  Description: Test the main function with valid height and weight inputs that result in an underweight BMI classification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for height and weight that will result in an underweight BMI.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output string correctly indicates an underweight BMI.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function accurately interprets BMI values that fall into the underweight category.

#### Scenario 3: Valid Inputs with Obese Class III BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_obese_class_iii
  Description: Test the main function with valid height and weight inputs that result in an obese class III BMI classification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for height and weight that results in an obese class III BMI.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: The output string should correctly indicate an obese class III BMI.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function can handle and correctly interpret higher BMI values, providing the appropriate classification.

#### Scenario 4: Zero Height Input
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_zero_height
  Description: Test the main function with a zero height input to trigger a division by zero handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for height as zero and any valid weight.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check for the output string indicating invalid input due to zero height.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle division by zero errors gracefully and inform the user about invalid input.

#### Scenario 5: Non-Numerical Input
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_non_numerical_input
  Description: Test the main function with non-numerical input to trigger the ValueError exception handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock user input for height or weight as a non-numerical string.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Expect the output to indicate invalid numerical input.
Validation:
  Ensures the function robustly handles non-numerical inputs and informs the user appropriately.

#### Scenario 6: Reference Chart Display
Details:
  TestName: test_main_reference_chart_display
  Description: Ensure that the reference chart is displayed when the main function is called.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup beyond mocking the file reading if necessary.
  Act: Call the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the reference chart is printed.
Validation:
  Ensures that the BMI reference chart is always displayed as part of the main function execution, providing necessary context to the user.

### Testing Guidelines
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
1. **Mocking User Input:** Use `unittest.mock` to simulate user input for `input()` calls within the `main` function.
2. **Mocking File Operations:** Mock file operations when testing the `reference_chart` function to avoid I/O during tests.
3. **Output Capture:** Use context managers or mocking to capture printed outputs for assertions.
4. **Exception Handling:** Ensure tests check for proper handling of exceptions like `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.
5. **Boundary Conditions:** Include tests for boundary conditions such as the edge values between BMI classifications.
6. **Reusability of Test Code:** Design tests to be reusable with parameterized inputs for different BMI categories.
7. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Cover all logical branches and user input scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs.
8. **Automated Testing Environment:** Ensure tests are designed to run in an automated test environment without requiring manual inputs.
9. **Documentation and Comments:** Clearly document the purpose and expected outcomes of each test for maintainability.
END_GUIDELINE

These guidelines and scenarios will help ensure that the `main` function is robustly tested, handling all user inputs gracefully and accurately calculating and classifying BMI values.
