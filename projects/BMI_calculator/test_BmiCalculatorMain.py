Scenario 1: Valid Input with Normal Weight
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_normal_weight
  Description: Test the main function with valid height and weight inputs that result in a normal BMI classification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for height and weight to simulate user input as '1.75' and '70' respectively.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches "Your BMI is 22.86, you have a normal weight."
Validation:
  This test validates that the main function correctly interprets a normal BMI based on valid user inputs. It ensures the function's ability to handle typical scenarios and produce the correct user feedback.

Scenario 2: Invalid Numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_invalid_input
  Description: Test the main function with non-numeric inputs to trigger a ValueError and check the error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for height and weight with invalid data such as 'two' and 'seventy'.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check if the output includes "Invalid input. Please enter numerical values for height and weight."
Validation:
  This test ensures that the main function properly handles erroneous non-numeric inputs by informing the user of the input error, adhering to the function's error handling specifications.

Scenario 3: Zero Height Input
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_zero_height
  Description: Test the main function with a height of zero to verify how the function handles a division by zero scenario indirectly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for height as '0' and any valid weight, e.g., '70'.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check if the output includes "Invalid input. Height should be greater than 0."
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring that the function can gracefully handle cases where the height is zero, which would lead to a mathematical error in BMI calculation. It checks the robustness of the error handling in the calculate_bmi function.

Scenario 4: Extremely High BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_extremely_high_bmi
  Description: Test the main function with inputs that result in an extremely high BMI to check if the function accurately classifies "obese (Class III)".
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input for height as '1.50' and weight as '150'.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Check if the output matches "Your BMI is 66.67, you are obese (Class III)."
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly classify extremely high BMI values, which is important for covering all potential user scenarios and maintaining accuracy in classifications.

Scenario 5: Reference Chart Display
Details:
  TestName: test_main_reference_chart_display
  Description: Verify that the reference_chart function is called and displays correctly when main is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the reference_chart function to confirm it's called.
  Act: Run the main function.
  Assert: Ensure that the reference_chart function is invoked.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the main function correctly invokes the reference_chart function, which is a critical part of the user interaction, providing necessary BMI reference information.
```

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
To ensure comprehensive and robust test coverage for the `main` function in the provided Python code, follow these guidelines:

1. **Mocking User Input and Outputs**: Utilize the `unittest.mock` library to simulate user inputs and outputs. This allows for the testing of input validation and handling without the need for actual user interaction.
2. **Testing Individual Components**: Break down tests to target individual components like `calculate_bmi` and `interpret_bmi` before integrating them into scenarios testing the `main` function. This modular approach helps identify the specific points of failure.
3. **Handling Exceptions**: Specifically test for various types of input that could lead to exceptions, such as non-numeric input or division by zero scenarios, to ensure the application handles these gracefully.
4. **Validating Printed Outputs**: Since the function prints results rather than returning them, tests will need to capture printed outputs and verify them against expected results.
5. **Edge Case Consideration**: Include tests for boundary values of BMI calculations (e.g., exactly 18.5, 24.9) to ensure classifications are accurately assigned according to the specified thresholds.
6. **Automating Environment Setup**: If the function requires specific files (like 'bmi.csv' for `reference_chart`), ensure the test environment automatically sets up and tears down these resources to maintain test isolation and reproducibility.

By adhering to these guidelines, tests can be structured to not only validate functional correctness but also to ensure error resilience and user feedback accuracy.
