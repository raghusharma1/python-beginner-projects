### Scenario 1: Normal Weight Calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_weight_bmi
  Description: This test verifies that the BMI is calculated and interpreted correctly for a person with normal weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set height and weight that results in a normal BMI range (e.g., height = 1.75 meters, weight = 70 kg).
  Act: Call `calculate_bmi` with the arranged parameters and then pass the result to `interpret_bmi`.
  Assert: Check that the output string confirms a normal BMI classification.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test by ensuring the function correctly interprets a common scenario where BMI falls in the normal range, which is critical for accurate health assessment.

### Scenario 2: Underweight Calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_underweight_bmi
  Description: Test to ensure that the BMI calculation and interpretation correctly identifies underweight status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide height and weight parameters that result in an underweight BMI (e.g., height = 1.75 meters, weight = 50 kg).
  Act: Invoke `calculate_bmi` and pass its result to `interpret_bmi`.
  Assert: The expected outcome should indicate that the person is underweight.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to alert users who might be at health risks due to low body weight.

### Scenario 3: Overweight Calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_overweight_bmi
  Description: Ensures that the BMI calculation and interpretation correctly identifies an overweight status.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input height and weight that lead to an overweight BMI (e.g., height = 1.75 meters, weight = 85 kg).
  Act: Execute `calculate_bmi` and use its output in `interpret_bmi`.
  Assert: Verify that the interpretation correctly classifies the BMI as overweight.
Validation:
  Critical for warning users about potential health issues associated with being overweight, aligning with preventive health care guidelines.

### Scenario 4: Obese Class III
Details:
  TestName: test_obese_class_iii_bmi
  Description: This test confirms that extremely high BMI values are classified as Obese Class III.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set parameters to a very high BMI value (e.g., height = 1.75 meters, weight = 130 kg).
  Act: Calculate BMI and interpret it.
  Assert: The output should classify the BMI as Obese Class III.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle high BMI values and categorize them correctly, which is essential for identifying serious health risks.

### Scenario 5: Zero Height Input
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_height
  Description: Tests the system's response to a zero height input, which should be handled gracefully to avoid division by zero errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a zero for height and any valid number for weight.
  Act: Attempt to calculate BMI.
  Assert: Check that the function returns `None` for BMI and that the interpretation indicates an invalid input.
Validation:
  Ensures robust error handling for unrealistic input, which is crucial for maintaining the reliability and stability of the application.

### Scenario 6: Invalid Numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_numeric_input
  Description: Verifies the application's response when non-numeric values are inputted for height or weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input of non-numeric strings for height and weight.
  Act: Run `main` and capture the output.
  Assert: The output should indicate an invalid input error message.
Validation:
  Ensures the application is user-friendly and informative when encountering input errors, which enhances usability and user experience.

### Scenario 7: Display Reference Chart
Details:
  TestName: test_display_reference_chart
  Description: Tests whether the reference chart is displayed correctly using the `reference_chart` function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement needed as this function reads from a file.
  Act: Call `reference_chart` and capture its output.
  Assert: Verify that the output includes the expected table headers and format.
Validation:
  Ensures that users can view the BMI reference chart correctly, which is useful for understanding BMI categories and enhancing user engagement with the application.
