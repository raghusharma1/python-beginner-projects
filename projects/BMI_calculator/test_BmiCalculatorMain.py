### Scenario 1: Normal Weight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_weight_classification
  Description: Verify that the function correctly interprets a BMI within the normal weight range.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up height and weight values that correspond to a BMI falling within the normal weight range (18.5 to 24.9).
  Act: Call `calculate_bmi` with the given height and weight, pass the result to `interpret_bmi`.
  Assert: Confirm that the output string indicates a normal weight classification.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of testing normal weight classification to ensure the function accurately represents common cases and provides the correct feedback.

### Scenario 2: Underweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_underweight_classification
  Description: Ensure the function accurately classifies an underweight BMI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide height and weight values resulting in a BMI less than 18.5.
  Act: Calculate BMI and interpret it.
  Assert: The output should correctly label the BMI as underweight.
Validation:
  Testing underweight classification is crucial to verify the function's ability to alert users who might be at health risk due to low body weight.

### Scenario 3: Overweight Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_overweight_classification
  Description: Verify correct classification and interpretation of an overweight BMI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input height and weight to produce a BMI between 25 and 29.9.
  Act: Compute and interpret BMI.
  Assert: Ensure the classification message correctly identifies the user as overweight.
Validation:
  This test checks the application's ability to warn users who are above normal weight but not yet obese, which is important for preventative health measures.

### Scenario 4: Obese Class I Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_obese_class_i_classification
  Description: Test the classification of obesity Class I.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set height and weight for a BMI between 30 and 34.9.
  Act: Calculate and interpret the BMI.
  Assert: The result should correctly indicate obesity Class I.
Validation:
  Confirming accurate classification of obesity Class I is crucial for correctly advising users about their significantly increased health risks.

### Scenario 5: Obese Class II Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_obese_class_ii_classification
  Description: Ensure the function correctly classifies and interprets obesity Class II.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input values to generate a BMI between 35 and 39.9.
  Act: Calculate BMI and use the interpretation function.
  Assert: The output should indicate obesity Class II.
Validation:
  It's important to verify this classification to ensure users receive the correct health warnings pertinent to their BMI range.

### Scenario 6: Obese Class III Classification
Details:
  TestName: test_obese_class_iii_classification
  Description: Test for correct classification of obesity Class III.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set parameters to achieve a BMI of 40 or more.
  Act: Calculate and interpret BMI.
  Assert: Check that the interpretation correctly identifies the user as obese Class III.
Validation:
  Testing this scenario is essential for ensuring the function can handle extreme cases and provide the necessary health advice.

### Scenario 7: Invalid Height Input Leading to None BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_height_input
  Description: Verify the function's response to an invalid (zero) height input leading to a BMI calculation of None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input zero for height and any valid number for weight.
  Act: Calculate BMI and interpret the result.
  Assert: The interpretation should return an error message about invalid input due to height.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles edge cases where user input might lead to mathematically impossible operations (division by zero).

### Scenario 8: Non-Numerical Input Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_non_numerical_input_handling
  Description: Verify that the function handles non-numerical inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Attempt to input strings or non-numeric data as height and weight.
  Act: Simulate the main function process.
  Assert: The system should catch a ValueError and notify the user of invalid input.
Validation:
  This scenario confirms the robustness of the user input handling, ensuring that the function prompts for correct data types and prevents runtime errors.
